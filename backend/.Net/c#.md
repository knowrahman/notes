Alright Rahman, let’s begin your deep dive into C#. I’ll explain it comprehensively, covering its history, features, syntax, programming paradigms, use cases, and advanced topics with examples. This will feel like a complete reference and a learning path.

---

### **1. What is C#?**

C# (pronounced *"C-Sharp"*) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. It was created by Anders Hejlsberg and launched in 2000.

It’s widely used for:
- Desktop applications (using Windows Forms or WPF)
- Web applications (ASP.NET)
- Mobile apps (Xamarin, MAUI)
- Game development (Unity)
- Cloud applications (Azure)
- APIs and microservices
- IoT and embedded systems

---

### **2. Key Features of C#**

- Strongly typed
- Object-oriented (supports classes, interfaces, inheritance)
- Component-oriented
- Managed language (memory managed by Garbage Collector)
- Rich library support via .NET Framework/.NET Core/.NET 5+
- LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Asynchronous programming with `async/await`
- Interoperability with other languages/platforms

---

### **3. Basic Syntax**

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

#### Key Components:
- `using System;` – Imports a namespace
- `class Program` – A class declaration
- `static void Main()` – Entry point of the application
- `Console.WriteLine()` – Prints to the console

---

### **4. Data Types**

- **Value Types:** `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `struct`, `enum`
- **Reference Types:** `string`, `object`, `class`, `interface`, `delegate`, `array`
- **Nullable Types:** `int?`, `double?` – used for null values in value types

---

### **5. Control Structures**

```csharp
if (x > 10) { ... }
else if (x == 10) { ... }
else { ... }

switch (x)
{
    case 1: break;
    default: break;
}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }
while (x > 0) { ... }
do { ... } while (x > 0);

foreach (var item in list) { ... }
```

---

### **6. Object-Oriented Concepts**

#### Classes and Objects

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving...");
}
```

#### Inheritance

```csharp
public class Animal { public void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Sound"); }
public class Dog : Animal { public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Bark"); }
```

#### Polymorphism

```csharp
public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Generic");
public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog Sound");
```

#### Interfaces

```csharp
public interface IDrivable { void Drive(); }
public class Car : IDrivable { public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving"); }
```

#### Abstract Classes

```csharp
public abstract class Shape { public abstract void Draw(); }
public class Circle : Shape { public override void Draw() => Console.WriteLine("Circle"); }
```

---

### **7. Advanced Topics**

- **LINQ**
```csharp
var results = people.Where(p => p.Age > 30).Select(p => p.Name);
```

- **Delegates and Events**
```csharp
delegate void MyDelegate(string msg);
event MyDelegate MyEvent;
```

- **Async Programming**
```csharp
async Task<int> GetDataAsync() => await Task.FromResult(42);
```

- **Exception Handling**
```csharp
try { ... }
catch (Exception ex) { ... }
finally { ... }
```

- **Generics**
```csharp
public class Box<T> { public T Value; }
```

- **Attributes**
```csharp
[Serializable]
class MyData { }
```

- **Reflection**
```csharp
var type = typeof(MyClass);
var methods = type.GetMethods();
```

---

### **8. .NET Ecosystem**

C# runs on the .NET platform which includes:
- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)** – executes the code
- **BCL (Base Class Library)** – collection of libraries for common tasks
- **NuGet** – package manager

Versions:
- .NET Framework (Windows-only)
- .NET Core (cross-platform)
- .NET 5+ (unified platform, latest versioning system)

---

### **9. Development Tools**

- Visual Studio (Windows)
- Visual Studio Code (Cross-platform)
- JetBrains Rider

Build tools: MSBuild, dotnet CLI

---

### **10. Real-world Use Cases**

- **Web API**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Web Apps**: ASP.NET Razor Pages / MVC
- **Games**: Unity Engine with C#
- **Mobile**: Xamarin or .NET MAUI
- **Cloud**: Azure Functions in C#
- **IoT**: Raspberry Pi + C# Apps

---


Great question, Rahman!

### **What is a Namespace in C#?**

A **namespace** in C# is like a container that organizes classes, interfaces, structs, enums, and delegates into a structured hierarchy. It helps prevent **naming conflicts** by grouping logically related code together.

#### Think of it like folders in a computer:
- You can have a file named `Program.cs` in two different folders without conflict.
- Similarly, you can have two classes with the same name as long as they’re in different namespaces.

---

### **Syntax**

```csharp
namespace MyApplication.Utilities
{
    public class Logger
    {
        public void Log(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `Logger` belongs to the namespace `MyApplication.Utilities`.

---

### **Using a Namespace**

To access classes or types inside a namespace, you can:

#### 1. **Use the full name:**
```csharp
MyApplication.Utilities.Logger logger = new MyApplication.Utilities.Logger();
```

#### 2. **Use the `using` directive:**
```csharp
using MyApplication.Utilities;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Logger logger = new Logger();
        logger.Log("Hello from Logger!");
    }
}
```

---

### **Why Use Namespaces?**

- **Organization:** Group related functionalities
- **Avoid Conflicts:** Prevent name collisions in large projects
- **Readability:** Make code easier to navigate and maintain
- **Modularity:** Split code into reusable components/libraries

---

### **Example with Conflict Avoidance**

```csharp
namespace ProjectA
{
    public class User { public string Name; }
}

namespace ProjectB
{
    public class User { public string Email; }
}
```

Now both `User` classes can coexist without issues because they're in different namespaces.

---

### Summary

- A **namespace** is a logical container for organizing code.
- It avoids naming conflicts.
- Use `using` to simplify access to types in a namespace.

---

Alright Rahman, let’s break down the **class structure** in C#, and understand how **getters and setters** work (also known as **properties** in C#).

---

## **1. Class Structure in C#**

A class in C# is a blueprint for creating objects. It contains **fields**, **properties**, **methods**, and **constructors**.

### **Basic Syntax**
```csharp
public class Person
{
    // Fields
    private string name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Methods
    public void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hi, my name is {name}, and I am {age} years old.");
    }
}
```

---

## **2. Getters and Setters (Properties)**

In C#, **getters and setters** are usually implemented as **properties**, which are wrappers around fields that control access.

### **2.1. Traditional Property**
```csharp
private string name;

public string Name
{
    get { return name; }
    set { name = value; }
}
```

You can use it like:
```csharp
Person p = new Person();
p.Name = "Rahman";        // Setter
Console.WriteLine(p.Name); // Getter
```

---

### **2.2. Auto-Implemented Property**
C# allows shorthand if you don’t need custom logic:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

You don’t need to declare a backing field (`private string name;`)—C# handles that behind the scenes.

---

### **2.3. Read-only Property**
If you want a property to be **read-only** (e.g., after construction):

```csharp
public string Id { get; } = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
```

Or:

```csharp
private string id;
public string Id
{
    get { return id; }
}
```

---

### **2.4. Property with Custom Logic**
You can also add validation or logic:

```csharp
private int age;
public int Age
{
    get { return age; }
    set
    {
        if (value > 0)
            age = value;
        else
            throw new ArgumentException("Age must be positive");
    }
}
```

---

## **3. Full Example**

```csharp
public class Product
{
    // Auto-property
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Custom property
    private decimal price;
    public decimal Price
    {
        get => price;
        set => price = value >= 0 ? value : throw new ArgumentException("Price can't be negative");
    }

    // Read-only property
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; } = DateTime.Now;

    // Method
    public void ShowInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name} costs {Price:C} and was added on {CreatedAt}");
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Summary

| Term           | Meaning                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `get`          | Reads the property value                  |
| `set`          | Writes the property value                 |
| Auto-property  | Shorthand without explicit field          |
| Backing field  | Manual private variable behind a property |
| Read-only      | No `set` or `set` is `private`            |
| Validation     | Add logic in `set` to control assignment  |

---

Great question, Rahman! In C#, there are **several ways to write constructors** depending on what you need—default values, overloading, chaining, object initializers, static constructors, and even using record types. Let’s go through them one by one with examples.

---

## **1. Default Constructor**
If you don’t define any constructor, C# provides a parameterless default constructor automatically.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;

    // Default constructor (created automatically if none is written)
    public Car() { }
}
```

---

## **2. Parameterized Constructor**
Allows you to initialize fields or properties when you create the object.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;

    public Car(string brand)
    {
        Brand = brand;
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");
```

---

## **3. Constructor Overloading**
Multiple constructors with different parameters.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;
    public int Year;

    public Car() { }

    public Car(string brand)
    {
        Brand = brand;
    }

    public Car(string brand, int year)
    {
        Brand = brand;
        Year = year;
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Constructor Chaining (`this`)**
You can call one constructor from another to avoid repeating logic.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;
    public int Year;

    public Car() : this("Unknown", 2000) { }

    public Car(string brand) : this(brand, 2020) { }

    public Car(string brand, int year)
    {
        Brand = brand;
        Year = year;
    }
}
```

---

## **5. Static Constructor**
Used to initialize static fields. Called only once automatically before any static members are used.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public static int Count;

    static Car()
    {
        Count = 0;
        Console.WriteLine("Static constructor called");
    }
}
```

You **can’t call or pass parameters** to a static constructor.

---

## **6. Using Object Initializers (Without Custom Constructor)**
Instead of creating constructors, use this cleaner approach for setting properties.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}

// Usage
var myCar = new Car
{
    Brand = "Toyota",
    Year = 2023
};
```

---

## **7. Record Type Constructors**
C# `record` types provide built-in constructors and immutability.

```csharp
public record Car(string Brand, int Year);
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
var car = new Car("Tesla", 2024);
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Type                  | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Default               | No arguments                                 |
| Parameterized         | Set values at initialization                 |
| Overloaded            | Multiple ways to construct object            |
| Chained               | Reuse logic among constructors               |
| Static                | Initialize static data                       |
| Object Initializer    | Cleaner property assignment syntax           |
| Record Constructor    | Concise immutable class for data structures  |

### Why no paranthesis for get set

Excellent question, Rahman.

In C#, when you write:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

You’re using what's called an **auto-implemented property**. This is a **shorthand syntax** provided by C# for declaring properties without explicitly defining a private backing field or custom logic.

Here’s why you don’t write parentheses like `get() { }`:

### 1. **Auto-implemented properties are not methods**
- `get` and `set` are **accessors**, not methods.
- You don't need parentheses unless you’re writing **custom logic** inside them.

### 2. **Simplified syntax**
This:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

Is shorthand for:

```csharp
private string _name;

public string Name
{
    get { return _name; }
    set { _name = value; }
}
```

In the above example, you’re **writing custom logic**, so `{}` is used.

---

### When do we write `get { }` and `set { }`?

Only when you want to include logic:

```csharp
private string _name;

public string Name
{
    get
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Getting name");
        return _name;
    }
    set
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value))
            _name = value;
    }
}
```

Here, `{}` is used because you’re manually coding the logic of the `get` and `set`.

---

### Summary

| Syntax                          | Use Case                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `get; set;`                      | Auto-property, compiler handles logic     |
| `get { ... } set { ... }`        | Manual property with custom logic         |
| `get => _name;` (expression)     | Shorthand for one-line logic (C# 6+)      |

---

## Records

In C#, a **record** is a special type introduced in C# 9.0 that is designed to make working with **immutable data models** and **value-based equality** easier and cleaner.

You can think of records as a concise way to create data containers where equality, `ToString()`, and immutability are handled for you automatically.

### Why use records?

1. They provide **value-based equality** (compared to classes, which use reference equality by default).
2. They simplify syntax for **immutable objects**.
3. They automatically generate:
   - Constructor
   - `ToString()`
   - `Equals()`
   - `GetHashCode()`
   - Deconstructors

---

### Basic Syntax

```csharp
public record Person(string Name, int Age);
```

This is equivalent to writing a full class with a constructor, read-only properties, equality logic, and more.

Usage:

```csharp
var p1 = new Person("Rahman", 25);
var p2 = new Person("Rahman", 25);

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2); // True (value comparison)
```

---

### Records vs Classes

- **Class** uses reference equality: two objects are equal only if they reference the same instance.
- **Record** uses value equality: two records are equal if their values are equal.

---

### Records with Custom Properties

```csharp
public record Product
{
    public string Name { get; init; }
    public decimal Price { get; init; }
}
```

Note: `init` allows the property to be set only during initialization.

```csharp
var product = new Product { Name = "Phone", Price = 499.99m };
```

---

### Positional Records vs Traditional Syntax

Positional:

```csharp
public record User(string Username, string Role);
```

Traditional:

```csharp
public record User
{
    public string Username { get; init; }
    public string Role { get; init; }
}
```

Both are valid; the positional version is shorter and generates more for you.

---

### Records Are Immutable By Default

When you define a record with positional parameters or with `init` setters, you can’t change values after the object is created:

```csharp
var u = new User("rahman", "admin");
// u.Role = "user"; // Error: cannot modify init-only property
```

---

The difference between **mutable** and **immutable** objects comes down to whether or not you can change the state of the object after it has been created.

### Mutable

A **mutable** object allows its fields or properties to be changed after the object is created.

Example:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

var p = new Person { Name = "Rahman" };
p.Name = "Rehman"; // This is allowed
```

Here, the `Name` property is mutable — it can be changed anytime.

### Immutable

An **immutable** object does not allow any change to its data after creation. Once it's constructed, its state remains constant.

Example with `record`:

```csharp
public record Person(string Name);

var p = new Person("Rahman");
// p.Name = "Rehman"; // Error: cannot modify
```

Another example using `init`:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; init; }
}

var p = new Person { Name = "Rahman" };
// p.Name = "Rehman"; // Error: cannot change init-only property
```

### Summary

| Type     | Can change data after creation? | Example usage          |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mutable  | Yes                           | `class` with `set`     |
| Immutable| No                            | `record`, `init`, readonly fields |

Immutable objects are often used in functional programming, thread-safe designs, and cases where data integrity is critical.

## Reflection

In C#, **reflection** is a powerful feature that allows your code to **inspect and interact with metadata** about types, objects, methods, properties, and other members **at runtime**.

It's part of the `System.Reflection` namespace.

You can use reflection to:

- Get information about assemblies, types, and members
- Create objects dynamically
- Invoke methods dynamically
- Access private members (carefully)
- Inspect attributes and custom metadata

---

### Basic Example: Get Type Information

```csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);

Console.WriteLine("Type name: " + type.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Namespace: " + type.Namespace);
```

---

### Example: Inspect Properties and Methods

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public void Greet() => Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}

Type type = typeof(Person);

foreach (var prop in type.GetProperties())
    Console.WriteLine("Property: " + prop.Name);

foreach (var method in type.GetMethods())
    Console.WriteLine("Method: " + method.Name);
```

---

### Example: Create Object at Runtime

```csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);
object obj = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
```

---

### Example: Invoke Method at Runtime

```csharp
MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("Greet");
method.Invoke(obj, null); // Runs Greet() on the object
```

---

### Example: Get Custom Attributes

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use NewMethod instead")]
public void OldMethod() { }

MethodInfo method = typeof(MyClass).GetMethod("OldMethod");
var attrs = method.GetCustomAttributes(false);

foreach (var attr in attrs)
    Console.WriteLine(attr.GetType().Name);
```

---

### Common Uses of Reflection

- Frameworks and libraries (e.g., serialization libraries like JSON.NET)
- Dependency injection containers
- Testing frameworks
- Plugins and extensibility systems
- Tools like ORMs (Entity Framework)
