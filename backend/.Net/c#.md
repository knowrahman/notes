Alright Rahman, let’s begin your deep dive into C#. I’ll explain it comprehensively, covering its history, features, syntax, programming paradigms, use cases, and advanced topics with examples. This will feel like a complete reference and a learning path.

---

### **1. What is C#?**

C# (pronounced *"C-Sharp"*) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. It was created by Anders Hejlsberg and launched in 2000.

It’s widely used for:
- Desktop applications (using Windows Forms or WPF)
- Web applications (ASP.NET)
- Mobile apps (Xamarin, MAUI)
- Game development (Unity)
- Cloud applications (Azure)
- APIs and microservices
- IoT and embedded systems

---

### **2. Key Features of C#**

- Strongly typed
- Object-oriented (supports classes, interfaces, inheritance)
- Component-oriented
- Managed language (memory managed by Garbage Collector)
- Rich library support via .NET Framework/.NET Core/.NET 5+
- LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Asynchronous programming with `async/await`
- Interoperability with other languages/platforms

---

### **3. Basic Syntax**

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

#### Key Components:
- `using System;` – Imports a namespace
- `class Program` – A class declaration
- `static void Main()` – Entry point of the application
- `Console.WriteLine()` – Prints to the console

---

### **4. Data Types**

- **Value Types:** `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `struct`, `enum`
- **Reference Types:** `string`, `object`, `class`, `interface`, `delegate`, `array`
- **Nullable Types:** `int?`, `double?` – used for null values in value types

---

### **5. Control Structures**

```csharp
if (x > 10) { ... }
else if (x == 10) { ... }
else { ... }

switch (x)
{
    case 1: break;
    default: break;
}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }
while (x > 0) { ... }
do { ... } while (x > 0);

foreach (var item in list) { ... }
```

---

### **6. Object-Oriented Concepts**

#### Classes and Objects

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving...");
}
```

#### Inheritance

```csharp
public class Animal { public void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Sound"); }
public class Dog : Animal { public void Bark() => Console.WriteLine("Bark"); }
```

#### Polymorphism

```csharp
public virtual void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Generic");
public override void Speak() => Console.WriteLine("Dog Sound");
```

#### Interfaces

```csharp
public interface IDrivable { void Drive(); }
public class Car : IDrivable { public void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Driving"); }
```

#### Abstract Classes

```csharp
public abstract class Shape { public abstract void Draw(); }
public class Circle : Shape { public override void Draw() => Console.WriteLine("Circle"); }
```

---

### **7. Advanced Topics**

- **LINQ**
```csharp
var results = people.Where(p => p.Age > 30).Select(p => p.Name);
```

- **Delegates and Events**
```csharp
delegate void MyDelegate(string msg);
event MyDelegate MyEvent;
```

- **Async Programming**
```csharp
async Task<int> GetDataAsync() => await Task.FromResult(42);
```

- **Exception Handling**
```csharp
try { ... }
catch (Exception ex) { ... }
finally { ... }
```

- **Generics**
```csharp
public class Box<T> { public T Value; }
```

- **Attributes**
```csharp
[Serializable]
class MyData { }
```

- **Reflection**
```csharp
var type = typeof(MyClass);
var methods = type.GetMethods();
```

---

### **8. .NET Ecosystem**

C# runs on the .NET platform which includes:
- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)** – executes the code
- **BCL (Base Class Library)** – collection of libraries for common tasks
- **NuGet** – package manager

Versions:
- .NET Framework (Windows-only)
- .NET Core (cross-platform)
- .NET 5+ (unified platform, latest versioning system)

---

### **9. Development Tools**

- Visual Studio (Windows)
- Visual Studio Code (Cross-platform)
- JetBrains Rider

Build tools: MSBuild, dotnet CLI

---

### **10. Real-world Use Cases**

- **Web API**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Web Apps**: ASP.NET Razor Pages / MVC
- **Games**: Unity Engine with C#
- **Mobile**: Xamarin or .NET MAUI
- **Cloud**: Azure Functions in C#
- **IoT**: Raspberry Pi + C# Apps

---


Great question, Rahman!

### **What is a Namespace in C#?**

A **namespace** in C# is like a container that organizes classes, interfaces, structs, enums, and delegates into a structured hierarchy. It helps prevent **naming conflicts** by grouping logically related code together.

#### Think of it like folders in a computer:
- You can have a file named `Program.cs` in two different folders without conflict.
- Similarly, you can have two classes with the same name as long as they’re in different namespaces.

---

### **Syntax**

```csharp
namespace MyApplication.Utilities
{
    public class Logger
    {
        public void Log(string message)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(message);
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `Logger` belongs to the namespace `MyApplication.Utilities`.

---

### **Using a Namespace**

To access classes or types inside a namespace, you can:

#### 1. **Use the full name:**
```csharp
MyApplication.Utilities.Logger logger = new MyApplication.Utilities.Logger();
```

#### 2. **Use the `using` directive:**
```csharp
using MyApplication.Utilities;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Logger logger = new Logger();
        logger.Log("Hello from Logger!");
    }
}
```

---

### **Why Use Namespaces?**

- **Organization:** Group related functionalities
- **Avoid Conflicts:** Prevent name collisions in large projects
- **Readability:** Make code easier to navigate and maintain
- **Modularity:** Split code into reusable components/libraries

---

### **Example with Conflict Avoidance**

```csharp
namespace ProjectA
{
    public class User { public string Name; }
}

namespace ProjectB
{
    public class User { public string Email; }
}
```

Now both `User` classes can coexist without issues because they're in different namespaces.

---

### Summary

- A **namespace** is a logical container for organizing code.
- It avoids naming conflicts.
- Use `using` to simplify access to types in a namespace.

---

Alright Rahman, let’s break down the **class structure** in C#, and understand how **getters and setters** work (also known as **properties** in C#).

---

## **1. Class Structure in C#**

A class in C# is a blueprint for creating objects. It contains **fields**, **properties**, **methods**, and **constructors**.

### **Basic Syntax**
```csharp
public class Person
{
    // Fields
    private string name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Methods
    public void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hi, my name is {name}, and I am {age} years old.");
    }
}
```

---

## **2. Getters and Setters (Properties)**

In C#, **getters and setters** are usually implemented as **properties**, which are wrappers around fields that control access.

### **2.1. Traditional Property**
```csharp
private string name;

public string Name
{
    get { return name; }
    set { name = value; }
}
```

You can use it like:
```csharp
Person p = new Person();
p.Name = "Rahman";        // Setter
Console.WriteLine(p.Name); // Getter
```

---

### **2.2. Auto-Implemented Property**
C# allows shorthand if you don’t need custom logic:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

You don’t need to declare a backing field (`private string name;`)—C# handles that behind the scenes.

---

### **2.3. Read-only Property**
If you want a property to be **read-only** (e.g., after construction):

```csharp
public string Id { get; } = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
```

Or:

```csharp
private string id;
public string Id
{
    get { return id; }
}
```

---

### **2.4. Property with Custom Logic**
You can also add validation or logic:

```csharp
private int age;
public int Age
{
    get { return age; }
    set
    {
        if (value > 0)
            age = value;
        else
            throw new ArgumentException("Age must be positive");
    }
}
```

---

## **3. Full Example**

```csharp
public class Product
{
    // Auto-property
    public string Name { get; set; }

    // Custom property
    private decimal price;
    public decimal Price
    {
        get => price;
        set => price = value >= 0 ? value : throw new ArgumentException("Price can't be negative");
    }

    // Read-only property
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; } = DateTime.Now;

    // Method
    public void ShowInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Name} costs {Price:C} and was added on {CreatedAt}");
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Summary

| Term           | Meaning                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `get`          | Reads the property value                  |
| `set`          | Writes the property value                 |
| Auto-property  | Shorthand without explicit field          |
| Backing field  | Manual private variable behind a property |
| Read-only      | No `set` or `set` is `private`            |
| Validation     | Add logic in `set` to control assignment  |

---

Great question, Rahman! In C#, there are **several ways to write constructors** depending on what you need—default values, overloading, chaining, object initializers, static constructors, and even using record types. Let’s go through them one by one with examples.

---

## **1. Default Constructor**
If you don’t define any constructor, C# provides a parameterless default constructor automatically.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;

    // Default constructor (created automatically if none is written)
    public Car() { }
}
```

---

## **2. Parameterized Constructor**
Allows you to initialize fields or properties when you create the object.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;

    public Car(string brand)
    {
        Brand = brand;
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
Car myCar = new Car("Toyota");
```

---

## **3. Constructor Overloading**
Multiple constructors with different parameters.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;
    public int Year;

    public Car() { }

    public Car(string brand)
    {
        Brand = brand;
    }

    public Car(string brand, int year)
    {
        Brand = brand;
        Year = year;
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Constructor Chaining (`this`)**
You can call one constructor from another to avoid repeating logic.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand;
    public int Year;

    public Car() : this("Unknown", 2000) { }

    public Car(string brand) : this(brand, 2020) { }

    public Car(string brand, int year)
    {
        Brand = brand;
        Year = year;
    }
}
```

---

## **5. Static Constructor**
Used to initialize static fields. Called only once automatically before any static members are used.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public static int Count;

    static Car()
    {
        Count = 0;
        Console.WriteLine("Static constructor called");
    }
}
```

You **can’t call or pass parameters** to a static constructor.

---

## **6. Using Object Initializers (Without Custom Constructor)**
Instead of creating constructors, use this cleaner approach for setting properties.

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Brand { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
}

// Usage
var myCar = new Car
{
    Brand = "Toyota",
    Year = 2023
};
```

---

## **7. Record Type Constructors**
C# `record` types provide built-in constructors and immutability.

```csharp
public record Car(string Brand, int Year);
```

**Usage:**
```csharp
var car = new Car("Tesla", 2024);
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Type                  | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Default               | No arguments                                 |
| Parameterized         | Set values at initialization                 |
| Overloaded            | Multiple ways to construct object            |
| Chained               | Reuse logic among constructors               |
| Static                | Initialize static data                       |
| Object Initializer    | Cleaner property assignment syntax           |
| Record Constructor    | Concise immutable class for data structures  |

### Why no paranthesis for get set

Excellent question, Rahman.

In C#, when you write:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

You’re using what's called an **auto-implemented property**. This is a **shorthand syntax** provided by C# for declaring properties without explicitly defining a private backing field or custom logic.

Here’s why you don’t write parentheses like `get() { }`:

### 1. **Auto-implemented properties are not methods**
- `get` and `set` are **accessors**, not methods.
- You don't need parentheses unless you’re writing **custom logic** inside them.

### 2. **Simplified syntax**
This:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

Is shorthand for:

```csharp
private string _name;

public string Name
{
    get { return _name; }
    set { _name = value; }
}
```

In the above example, you’re **writing custom logic**, so `{}` is used.

---

### When do we write `get { }` and `set { }`?

Only when you want to include logic:

```csharp
private string _name;

public string Name
{
    get
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Getting name");
        return _name;
    }
    set
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value))
            _name = value;
    }
}
```

Here, `{}` is used because you’re manually coding the logic of the `get` and `set`.

---

### Summary

| Syntax                          | Use Case                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `get; set;`                      | Auto-property, compiler handles logic     |
| `get { ... } set { ... }`        | Manual property with custom logic         |
| `get => _name;` (expression)     | Shorthand for one-line logic (C# 6+)      |

---

## Records

In C#, a **record** is a special type introduced in C# 9.0 that is designed to make working with **immutable data models** and **value-based equality** easier and cleaner.

You can think of records as a concise way to create data containers where equality, `ToString()`, and immutability are handled for you automatically.

### Why use records?

1. They provide **value-based equality** (compared to classes, which use reference equality by default).
2. They simplify syntax for **immutable objects**.
3. They automatically generate:
   - Constructor
   - `ToString()`
   - `Equals()`
   - `GetHashCode()`
   - Deconstructors

---

### Basic Syntax

```csharp
public record Person(string Name, int Age);
```

This is equivalent to writing a full class with a constructor, read-only properties, equality logic, and more.

Usage:

```csharp
var p1 = new Person("Rahman", 25);
var p2 = new Person("Rahman", 25);

Console.WriteLine(p1 == p2); // True (value comparison)
```

---

### Records vs Classes

- **Class** uses reference equality: two objects are equal only if they reference the same instance.
- **Record** uses value equality: two records are equal if their values are equal.

---

### Records with Custom Properties

```csharp
public record Product
{
    public string Name { get; init; }
    public decimal Price { get; init; }
}
```

Note: `init` allows the property to be set only during initialization.

```csharp
var product = new Product { Name = "Phone", Price = 499.99m };
```

---

### Positional Records vs Traditional Syntax

Positional:

```csharp
public record User(string Username, string Role);
```

Traditional:

```csharp
public record User
{
    public string Username { get; init; }
    public string Role { get; init; }
}
```

Both are valid; the positional version is shorter and generates more for you.

---

### Records Are Immutable By Default

When you define a record with positional parameters or with `init` setters, you can’t change values after the object is created:

```csharp
var u = new User("rahman", "admin");
// u.Role = "user"; // Error: cannot modify init-only property
```

---

The difference between **mutable** and **immutable** objects comes down to whether or not you can change the state of the object after it has been created.

### Mutable

A **mutable** object allows its fields or properties to be changed after the object is created.

Example:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

var p = new Person { Name = "Rahman" };
p.Name = "Rehman"; // This is allowed
```

Here, the `Name` property is mutable — it can be changed anytime.

### Immutable

An **immutable** object does not allow any change to its data after creation. Once it's constructed, its state remains constant.

Example with `record`:

```csharp
public record Person(string Name);

var p = new Person("Rahman");
// p.Name = "Rehman"; // Error: cannot modify
```

Another example using `init`:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; init; }
}

var p = new Person { Name = "Rahman" };
// p.Name = "Rehman"; // Error: cannot change init-only property
```

### Summary

| Type     | Can change data after creation? | Example usage          |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Mutable  | Yes                           | `class` with `set`     |
| Immutable| No                            | `record`, `init`, readonly fields |

Immutable objects are often used in functional programming, thread-safe designs, and cases where data integrity is critical.

## Reflection

In C#, **reflection** is a powerful feature that allows your code to **inspect and interact with metadata** about types, objects, methods, properties, and other members **at runtime**.

It's part of the `System.Reflection` namespace.

You can use reflection to:

- Get information about assemblies, types, and members
- Create objects dynamically
- Invoke methods dynamically
- Access private members (carefully)
- Inspect attributes and custom metadata

---

### Basic Example: Get Type Information

```csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);

Console.WriteLine("Type name: " + type.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Namespace: " + type.Namespace);
```

---

### Example: Inspect Properties and Methods

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public void Greet() => Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}

Type type = typeof(Person);

foreach (var prop in type.GetProperties())
    Console.WriteLine("Property: " + prop.Name);

foreach (var method in type.GetMethods())
    Console.WriteLine("Method: " + method.Name);
```

---

### Example: Create Object at Runtime

```csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);
object obj = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
```

---

### Example: Invoke Method at Runtime

```csharp
MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("Greet");
method.Invoke(obj, null); // Runs Greet() on the object
```

---

### Example: Get Custom Attributes

```csharp
[Obsolete("Use NewMethod instead")]
public void OldMethod() { }

MethodInfo method = typeof(MyClass).GetMethod("OldMethod");
var attrs = method.GetCustomAttributes(false);

foreach (var attr in attrs)
    Console.WriteLine(attr.GetType().Name);
```

---

### Common Uses of Reflection

- Frameworks and libraries (e.g., serialization libraries like JSON.NET)
- Dependency injection containers
- Testing frameworks
- Plugins and extensibility systems
- Tools like ORMs (Entity Framework)

---

Alright Rahman, here’s a detailed explanation of **encapsulation** in C#, covering all access modifiers with full context, use cases, real-world analogies, and examples.

---

Encapsulation is the **OOP principle** of hiding internal object details and exposing only what’s necessary through a controlled interface. In C#, this is implemented using **access modifiers** that define the **visibility** of classes and their members.

---

## Access Modifiers in C#

C# provides six access modifiers:

1. public  
2. private  
3. protected  
4. internal  
5. protected internal  
6. private protected  

Each modifier controls where a class or its member (method, property, etc.) can be accessed from.

---

### 1. public

**Meaning**: The type or member is accessible from **anywhere** in the project or even from another assembly.

**Use case**: Use it for APIs, models, or services meant to be consumed by other classes or projects.

**Real-world analogy**: A library's public catalog — anyone can view it.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class Car
{
    public string Model { get; set; }

    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving...");
    }
}
```

You can access `Model` and `Drive()` from any class.

---

### 2. private

**Meaning**: The type or member is accessible only **within the same class**.

**Use case**: Hide internal fields, helper methods, or sensitive logic.

**Real-world analogy**: A person’s PIN code — private to them only.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance = 0;

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public decimal GetBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

`balance` cannot be accessed outside directly, only via public methods.

---

### 3. protected

**Meaning**: Accessible in the **same class** or **any subclass** (derived class), even if subclass is in a different file.

**Use case**: Share reusable logic with child classes but not expose it to the outside.

**Real-world analogy**: A protected vault only staff can enter.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    protected void Breathe()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Breathing...");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void StartBreathing()
    {
        Breathe(); // allowed
    }
}
```

`Breathe()` is not accessible outside Animal or Dog.

---

### 4. internal

**Meaning**: Accessible **only within the same project (assembly)**, not outside even if marked public.

**Use case**: Helper classes, utilities, data loaders — things that should be hidden from external projects.

**Real-world analogy**: A company intranet — accessible only within the organization.

**Example**:

```csharp
internal class FileHelper
{
    internal void Load() { }
}
```

This `FileHelper` class cannot be used from another project.

---

### 5. protected internal

**Meaning**: Accessible from:
- Any class in the **same assembly**
- Any **derived class**, even in a different assembly

**Use case**: Expose something to your own project and trusted subclasses.

**Real-world analogy**: A corporate manager can access protected files across branches and departments.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class Base
{
    protected internal void Log() { }
}

public class Sub : Base
{
    public void CallLog()
    {
        Log(); // allowed
    }
}
```

Also accessible to other classes in the same project.

---

### 6. private protected

**Meaning**: Accessible **only** from the **same assembly** and only by **derived classes**.

**Use case**: Most restrictive access for internal inheritance logic.

**Real-world analogy**: A confidential memo accessible only to team leaders in a specific office.

**Example**:

```csharp
public class SecureData
{
    private protected void Encrypt() { }
}

public class InternalTool : SecureData
{
    public void DoWork()
    {
        Encrypt(); // allowed only if in same project
    }
}
```

This method is not visible outside the assembly, even to subclasses.

---

| protected internal  | Same project + subclasses in any project              |
| private protected   | Same project + subclasses in same project only        |

## Real-World Example: Hospital System

```csharp
public class Patient
{
    public string Name { get; set; } // visible to all

    private string SSN;              // sensitive, hide from outside

    protected string Diagnosis;      // visible to doctors (subclasses)

    internal void LoadInternalRecords() { } // visible to all code in the system

    protected internal void LogAccess() { } // for system logs and subclasses

    private protected void ValidateInsurance() { } // strict internal use
}
```

This kind of encapsulation protects sensitive data, enforces access rules, and makes the system robust.

---

Here are practical examples where access modifiers in C# would result in **compiler errors** when used incorrectly. Each example includes the reason and context for the error.

---

### 1. Accessing a `private` member from outside the class

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance = 1000;
}

public class Test
{
    public void TryAccess()
    {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();
        Console.WriteLine(acc.balance); // Error: 'balance' is inaccessible due to its protection level
    }
}
```

**Why it fails**: `balance` is `private`, only accessible inside `BankAccount`.

---

### 2. Accessing a `protected` member from a non-derived class

```csharp
public class Animal
{
    protected void Breathe() { }
}

public class Test
{
    public void TryAccess()
    {
        Animal a = new Animal();
        a.Breathe(); // Error: 'Breathe' is inaccessible due to its protection level
    }
}
```

**Why it fails**: `Breathe` is `protected`, and `Test` is not a subclass of `Animal`.

---

### 3. Accessing an `internal` class from another project

```csharp
// In Project A
internal class FileManager
{
    public void Load() { }
}

// In Project B (reference to Project A added)
public class Test
{
    public void TryAccess()
    {
        FileManager f = new FileManager(); // Error: 'FileManager' is inaccessible due to its protection level
    }
}
```

**Why it fails**: `internal` restricts access to the same assembly. Other projects can’t use `FileManager`.

---

### 4. Accessing a `private protected` member from a derived class in another assembly

```csharp
// In Project A
public class Base
{
    private protected void Configure() { }
}

// In Project B
public class Derived : Base
{
    public void TryAccess()
    {
        Configure(); // Error: 'Configure' is inaccessible due to its protection level
    }
}
```

**Why it fails**: `private protected` allows access only within the same assembly and derived classes. This subclass is in a different assembly.

---

### 5. Accessing a `protected internal` member from a non-derived class in another assembly

```csharp
// In Project A
public class Base
{
    protected internal void Setup() { }
}

// In Project B
public class OtherClass
{
    public void TryAccess()
    {
        Base b = new Base();
        b.Setup(); // Error: 'Setup' is inaccessible due to its protection level
    }
}
```

**Why it fails**: `protected internal` is accessible from other assemblies only if the class is derived. `OtherClass` is not a subclass.

---

Here’s a complete and practical breakdown of **interfaces vs abstract classes** in C#, including differences, use cases, when to use which, and a real-world example.

---

## Interface vs Abstract Class: Purpose

- **Interface** defines a **contract**: what a class must do, without saying how.
- **Abstract class** provides a **partial implementation** and shared behavior.

---

## Syntax Overview

**Interface:**

```csharp
public interface IPrintable
{
    void Print();
}
```

**Abstract Class:**

```csharp
public abstract class Document
{
    public string Title { get; set; }

    public abstract void Print(); // Must be overridden

    public void Save()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Document saved.");
    }
}
```

---

## Key Differences

| Feature                      | Interface                          | Abstract Class                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Inheritance                 | A class can implement **multiple** | A class can inherit **only one**      |
| Implementation              | No method body (except default)    | Can have both abstract and concrete methods |
| Constructors                | Not allowed                        | Allowed                               |
| Fields                      | Not allowed                        | Allowed (fields, properties, etc.)    |
| Accessibility Modifiers     | Not allowed on members             | Allowed (public, protected, etc.)     |
| Use case                    | Define capability or behavior      | Define base identity and logic        |

---

## When to Use an Interface

Use an interface when:

- You want to define **capabilities** (e.g., "can print", "can send email").
- You need **multiple inheritance** of behavior.
- You want to allow unrelated types to implement the same contract.

**Example:**

```csharp
public interface IPlayable
{
    void Play();
}

public class Music : IPlayable
{
    public void Play() => Console.WriteLine("Playing music...");
}

public class Video : IPlayable
{
    public void Play() => Console.WriteLine("Playing video...");
}
```

Here, `Music` and `Video` share the same behavior contract even though they are unrelated.

---

## When to Use an Abstract Class

Use an abstract class when:

- You want to share **common code** among related classes.
- You want to force **derived classes to override** some members, but also provide shared logic.
- The types share a common identity or concept.

**Example:**

```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public string Model { get; set; }

    public abstract void Drive();

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vehicle started");
    }
}

public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Drive() => Console.WriteLine("Car is driving");
}
```

`Vehicle` contains shared logic (`Start`) and requires `Drive` to be implemented.

---

## Real-World Use Case: Printing System

Imagine building a **document processing system** where different types of documents (PDF, Word, Excel) can be printed and saved.

**Use Interface for behavior**:

```csharp
public interface IPrintable
{
    void Print();
}
```

**Use Abstract Class for shared data and base logic**:

```csharp
public abstract class Document
{
    public string Title { get; set; }

    public void Save()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{Title} saved to disk.");
    }

    public abstract void Print();
}
```

**Concrete Implementation**:

```csharp
public class PdfDocument : Document, IPrintable
{
    public override void Print()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing PDF...");
    }
}
```

---

## Summary

Use **interfaces** when:

- You need multiple inheritance
- You're defining capabilities or loosely related behaviors
- You’re working with dependency injection or mocking

Use **abstract classes** when:

- You want to provide base behavior and force certain overrides
- You’re modeling a base identity or category (like `Animal`, `Vehicle`, `Shape`)
- Only single inheritance is needed

---

Thanks for the honest feedback, Rahman. Let's break down `async`, `await`, `Task`, and multithreading with **more detail**, **real-life explanations**, **sample code**, and **expected outputs**.

---

## What is Asynchronous Programming?

Imagine you're cooking:

- You put rice on the stove (which takes 20 minutes).
- While the rice is cooking, you chop vegetables and grill chicken.

This is **asynchronous** — you don’t just stand there waiting for the rice.

In programming, **asynchronous code** lets your program do other tasks while waiting (like downloading, querying, reading files).

---

## Basic Concepts

### 1. `Task` — Represents a background operation.

Think of `Task` as a to-do item that will finish **later**.

```csharp
Task task = Task.Run(() => Console.WriteLine("Doing work in background"));
```

---

### 2. `async` and `await` — Tell C# to run the task asynchronously.

- `async` is put before the method.
- `await` waits for the `Task` to finish **without freezing** the program.

```csharp
public async Task DoWorkAsync()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Work started...");
    await Task.Delay(3000); // Simulate 3-second task
    Console.WriteLine("Work completed!");
}
```

---

## Example: Async Download Simulation

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Start downloading file...");
        
        await Task.Delay(3000); // Simulates delay

        Console.WriteLine("File downloaded!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Start downloading file...
(wait 3 seconds)
File downloaded!
```

Even though you’re waiting 3 seconds, the program doesn’t freeze — it continues if you had other work after `await`.

---

## What Happens If You Don't Use `await`?

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    DownloadFile(); // Async method not awaited
    Console.WriteLine("Other work");
}

public static async Task DownloadFile()
{
    await Task.Delay(3000);
    Console.WriteLine("File downloaded!");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Other work
(wait 3 seconds)
File downloaded!
```

But there's a problem: You don’t **wait** for the file to finish downloading. In real apps, it could end too soon.

---

## Example: Using `Task.Run` for CPU Work

Let’s say you’re calculating the sum of 1 to 1 million:

```csharp
public static async Task Main()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Calculation started...");
    
    int result = await Task.Run(() =>
    {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= 1_000_000; i++) sum += i;
        return sum;
    });

    Console.WriteLine($"Calculation finished. Result = {result}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Calculation started...
Calculation finished. Result = 500000500000
```

---

## Multithreading Example

Here’s how to run work in a new thread manually:

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    Thread thread = new Thread(() =>
    {
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
        Console.WriteLine("Running on a new thread");
    });

    thread.Start();

    Console.WriteLine("Main thread running");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Main thread running
(wait 2 seconds)
Running on a new thread
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

| Real-world Example        | Use `async` / `await` | Use `Task.Run` or threads |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Web API call              | Yes                   | No                        |
| Download a file           | Yes                   | No                        |
| Process a large image     | Maybe                 | Yes                       |
| UI application            | Yes                   | Maybe                     |
| Game loop (frame update)  | No                    | Yes (multithreading)      |
| Send an email             | Yes                   | No                        |
| Export large report       | Maybe                 | Yes                       |

Great, Rahman. Here's a single `.cs` file you can paste into a new Console App project in Visual Studio or VS Code.

### File: `Program.cs`

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("=== Task Examples ===\n");

        await BasicTask();
        await TaskWithResult();
        await MultipleTasks();
        await TaskWithException();
        await TaskWithCancellation();
        await SimulatedDownload();

        Console.WriteLine("\nAll tasks completed.");
    }

    static async Task BasicTask()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n[Basic Task]");
        await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            Console.WriteLine("Task with no return value completed.");
        });
    }

    static async Task TaskWithResult()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n[Task With Result]");
        int result = await Task.Run(() =>
        {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= 100000; i++) sum += i;
            return sum;
        });
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
    }

    static async Task MultipleTasks()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n[Multiple Tasks in Parallel]");
        Task t1 = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            Console.WriteLine("Task 1 done");
        });

        Task t2 = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(2000);
            Console.WriteLine("Task 2 done");
        });

        await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2);
        Console.WriteLine("Both tasks completed.");
    }

    static async Task TaskWithException()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n[Task With Exception Handling]");
        try
        {
            await Task.Run(() =>
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Something went wrong inside the task.");
            });
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Caught exception: {ex.Message}");
        }
    }

    static async Task TaskWithCancellation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n[Task With Cancellation]");
        var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
        var token = cts.Token;

        var task = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                if (token.IsCancellationRequested)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Task was cancelled.");
                    return;
                }

                Thread.Sleep(500);
                Console.WriteLine($"Running... {i}");
            }
        }, token);

        // Cancel after 2 seconds
        await Task.Delay(2000);
        cts.Cancel();

        await task;
    }

    static async Task SimulatedDownload()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n[Simulated File Download]");
        Console.WriteLine("Starting download...");
        await Task.Delay(3000); // Simulated delay
        Console.WriteLine("Download complete!");
    }
}
```

### How to Use

1. Open Visual Studio or VS Code.
2. Create a new **Console App (.NET 6 or .NET 7)**.
3. Replace the content of `Program.cs` with the code above.
4. Run the app.

This gives you a working playground to understand and test Task behaviors with live console output.

Great, Rahman. Let's now explore some **advanced and essential concepts related to `Task`** in C# including:

1. `Task.WhenAny`
2. `Task.WhenAll`
3. `Task.WaitAll`, `Task.WaitAny`
4. Fire-and-forget tasks
5. Task continuations
6. Task chaining
7. Task status

Each is explained with usage, real-world analogy, sample code, and output.

---

## 1. Task.WhenAny

**What it does**: Waits until **any one task** completes (the fastest one), and returns it.

**Example:**

```csharp
var t1 = Task.Delay(2000).ContinueWith(_ => "Task 1");
var t2 = Task.Delay(1000).ContinueWith(_ => "Task 2");

var first = await Task.WhenAny(t1, t2);

Console.WriteLine($"First completed: {first.Result}");
```

**Output:**
```
First completed: Task 2
```

**Real-world use**: Query multiple backup servers and return the first successful response.

---

## 2. Task.WhenAll

**What it does**: Waits for **all tasks** to finish.

```csharp
var t1 = Task.Delay(2000);
var t2 = Task.Delay(1000);
await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2);

Console.WriteLine("Both tasks finished");
```

**Real-world use**: Run multiple independent operations like:
- Sending emails
- Writing logs
- Saving data

---

## 3. Task.WaitAll and Task.WaitAny

These are **synchronous** versions of `WhenAll` and `WhenAny`.

```csharp
Task t1 = Task.Run(() => Thread.Sleep(1000));
Task t2 = Task.Run(() => Thread.Sleep(2000));

Task.WaitAll(t1, t2); // blocks thread
Console.WriteLine("Both done (WaitAll)");

int index = Task.WaitAny(t1, t2); // returns index
Console.WriteLine($"Task at index {index} finished first");
```

Not recommended in async methods — use `await Task.WhenAll` instead.

---

## 4. Fire-and-Forget Tasks

**What it means**: Start a background task without awaiting or capturing the result.

```csharp
Task.Run(() => Console.WriteLine("Doing background work"));
```

Be careful: exceptions in fire-and-forget tasks **are not caught** unless you handle them explicitly.

**Safe fire-and-forget** with exception handling:

```csharp
_ = Task.Run(() =>
{
    try
    {
        // your logic here
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Handled: {ex.Message}");
    }
});
```

**Real-world use**: Logging, sending notifications.

---

## 5. Task Continuations (`ContinueWith`)

Runs **another task after** the first one finishes.

```csharp
Task.Run(() => "First Task")
    .ContinueWith(t => Console.WriteLine($"Finished: {t.Result}"));
```

Note: Prefer `await` in most modern code unless chaining multiple steps.

---

## 6. Task Chaining with `await`

```csharp
async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return "Data";
}

async Task RunAsync()
{
    var result = await GetDataAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

This is preferred over `ContinueWith` for readability and better error handling.

---

## 7. Task Status and State

A task has a `Status` property:

```csharp
var task = Task.Run(() => Thread.Sleep(1000));
Console.WriteLine(task.Status); // Usually WaitingToRun or Running

await task;
Console.WriteLine(task.Status); // RanToCompletion
```

Other states include:
- `Created`
- `Running`
- `RanToCompletion`
- `Canceled`
- `Faulted`

Useful when tracking task lifecycle.

Alright Rahman, let’s dive deep into **delegates** in C#. It’s a core concept that gives C# a lot of flexibility — especially for event-driven, callback, and plug-in style programming.

---

## What is a Delegate?

A **delegate** is a type that represents a **reference to a method**.  
You can think of a delegate as a **function pointer** — it allows you to **store**, **pass**, and **call methods** dynamically.

### Real-world analogy:
Think of a delegate like giving someone your phone number — they can now contact (invoke) you whenever they need.

---

## Why use delegates?

- To pass methods as arguments (callback functions)
- To create flexible and reusable components
- To implement event handling systems
- To support LINQ and asynchronous methods

---

## Basic Syntax

### Step 1: Declare a delegate type

```csharp
public delegate void PrintDelegate(string message);
```

This defines a delegate that can point to any method that returns `void` and takes a `string` as a parameter.

---

### Step 2: Create a method matching that signature

```csharp
public static void PrintMessage(string msg)
{
    Console.WriteLine(msg);
}
```

---

### Step 3: Assign and invoke

```csharp
PrintDelegate del = PrintMessage;
del("Hello, Rahman");
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Rahman
```

---

## Multicast Delegates

You can assign **multiple methods** to a delegate using `+=`.

```csharp
public static void PrintUpper(string msg) => Console.WriteLine(msg.ToUpper());
public static void PrintLower(string msg) => Console.WriteLine(msg.ToLower());

PrintDelegate del = PrintUpper;
del += PrintLower;

del("HeLLo"); 
```

**Output:**
```
HELLO
hello
```

---

## Delegates as Parameters

```csharp
public static void Execute(string name, PrintDelegate action)
{
    action(name);
}

Execute("Rahman", PrintMessage);
```

This allows for **plug-in** behavior — the method doesn’t care *what* it’s calling, as long as it fits the delegate type.

---

## Built-in Delegate Types

C# provides generic delegates so you don’t have to define your own:

- `Action` — for methods that return `void`
- `Func<T>` — for methods that return a value
- `Predicate<T>` — returns a `bool`

**Example:**

```csharp
Action<string> print = msg => Console.WriteLine("Message: " + msg);
Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;
Predicate<int> isEven = x => x % 2 == 0;

print("Test");
Console.WriteLine(add(3, 5));     // 8
Console.WriteLine(isEven(10));   // True
```

---

## Summary

| Type            | Purpose                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `delegate`      | User-defined method reference       |
| `Action`        | Void-returning method               |
| `Func<T>`       | Method with return value            |
| `Predicate<T>`  | Method that returns bool            |

---

Let’s dive into **generics** in C#, Rahman. This is one of the most powerful and reusable features in the language.

---

## What are Generics?

Generics allow you to define **classes**, **methods**, **interfaces**, and **delegates** with **a placeholder type**, so you can reuse the same code with **different data types**.

### Real-world analogy:
A **generic box** that can hold anything — books, clothes, electronics — depending on what you want.

---

## Why Use Generics?

1. **Type safety**: Errors caught at compile time
2. **Reusability**: One class/method works with many types
3. **Performance**: Avoids boxing/unboxing
4. **Cleaner code**: No duplicate versions for each data type

---

## Generic Class Example

```csharp
public class Box<T>
{
    public T Item { get; set; }

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Item: " + Item);
    }
}
```

**Usage:**

```csharp
var intBox = new Box<int> { Item = 100 };
intBox.Display(); // Item: 100

var strBox = new Box<string> { Item = "Rahman" };
strBox.Display(); // Item: Rahman
```

`T` is a **type parameter** — replaced with the actual type during use.

---

## Generic Method Example

```csharp
public static void Swap<T>(ref T a, ref T b)
{
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```

**Usage:**

```csharp
int x = 5, y = 10;
Swap(ref x, ref y);
Console.WriteLine(x); // 10
Console.WriteLine(y); // 5
```

---

## Generic Interface Example

```csharp
public interface IRepository<T>
{
    void Add(T item);
    T Get(int id);
}
```

Then implement it for any type:

```csharp
public class ProductRepository : IRepository<Product>
{
    public void Add(Product item) { }
    public Product Get(int id) => new Product();
}
```

---

## Generic Constraints

You can restrict what kinds of types are allowed using **where** clauses:

```csharp
public class DataService<T> where T : class
{
    public void Save(T data)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Saved: " + data.ToString());
    }
}
```

Other constraints:
- `where T : class` → reference type only
- `where T : struct` → value types only
- `where T : new()` → must have a parameterless constructor
- `where T : SomeBaseClass` → must inherit from a class
- `where T : ISomeInterface` → must implement an interface

## Built-in Generic Types

| Generic Type         | Purpose                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `List<T>`            | Dynamic array                    |
| `Dictionary<K, V>`   | Key-value store                  |
| `Queue<T>`           | FIFO queue                       |
| `Stack<T>`           | LIFO stack                       |
| `Nullable<T>`        | Optional value for value types   |

**Example:**

```csharp
List<string> names = new List<string> { "A", "B", "C" };
Dictionary<int, string> users = new Dictionary<int, string> { {1, "Rahman"} };
```

---

## Summary

Generics let you write **flexible**, **type-safe**, and **reusable** code. You define the logic once and use it with different types.

Let’s go over **exception handling** in C#, Rahman — what it is, how it works, best practices, and real-world examples. You’ll learn everything from the basic `try-catch` block to creating custom exceptions.

---

## What Is an Exception?

An **exception** is an error that occurs **during runtime** which disrupts the normal flow of the program.

Examples:
- Dividing by zero
- Accessing a null object
- Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist

---

## Basic Exception Handling Syntax

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Optional: runs no matter what
}
```

---

## Example: Divide by Zero

```csharp
try
{
    int x = 10;
    int y = 0;
    int result = x / y;
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero!");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Cannot divide by zero!
```

---

## Multiple Catch Blocks

You can handle **specific** exceptions first, then a general one:

```csharp
try
{
    int[] arr = new int[3];
    Console.WriteLine(arr[5]);
}
catch (IndexOutOfRangeException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Index out of range.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred.");
}
```

---

## The `finally` Block

This block **always runs**, whether an exception was thrown or not.

```csharp
try
{
    Console.WriteLine("Try block");
}
catch
{
    Console.WriteLine("Catch block");
}
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("Always runs");
}
```

---

## Throwing Exceptions

Use `throw` to manually raise an exception.

```csharp
public void ValidateAge(int age)
{
    if (age < 0)
        throw new ArgumentException("Age cannot be negative");
}
```

---

## Rethrowing an Exception

Sometimes you want to log it and then rethrow it:

```csharp
try
{
    // code
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Logging error...");
    throw; // rethrows original exception
}
```

---

## Custom Exceptions

You can create your own exception classes for better error handling.

```csharp
public class InvalidUserException : Exception
{
    public InvalidUserException(string message) : base(message) { }
}
```

**Usage:**

```csharp
throw new InvalidUserException("User is not authorized.");
```

---

## Common Exception Types

| Exception                  | Thrown when...                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `DivideByZeroException`   | Division by zero                                |
| `NullReferenceException`  | Accessing a null object                         |
| `IndexOutOfRangeException`| Invalid array index                             |
| `FileNotFoundException`   | File doesn’t exist                              |
| `InvalidOperationException`| Invalid operation for the current state        |
| `ArgumentException`       | Invalid arguments passed                        |

---

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Catch the most specific exceptions first
- **Avoid empty catch**: Always log or act
- **Use `finally`** for cleanup like closing files or DB connections
- **Don’t swallow exceptions** unless necessary
- **Log errors**: for debugging and monitoring

---

## Real-World Example: File Read

```csharp
try
{
    string content = File.ReadAllText("info.txt");
    Console.WriteLine(content);
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("File not found.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong.");
}
finally
{
    Console.WriteLine("Finished trying to read the file.");
}
```
