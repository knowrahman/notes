Basic AWS Lambda Interview Questions
------------------------------------

Let's begin with the basics. Whether you're new to AWS Lambda or simply brushing up, these fundamentals will prepare you for a deeper dive into Lambda's capabilities.

### 1\. What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

### 2\. What are the main components of a Lambda function?

The main components of a Lambda function are:

-   **Handler:** This is the entry point for our function, a method in our code that processes the invocation event. Think of it as the "main" function of our Lambda code.
-   **Event:** This is the JSON-formatted input data that triggers the function's execution. It carries information about what initiated the function call.
-   **Context:** This is an object containing runtime information about the function's execution environment. It includes details like function name, version, memory limits, request ID, and remaining execution time.
-   **Environment variables:** These are key-value pairs that you can set to configure your Lambda function's behavior without modifying the code itself. They are often used to store API keys, database credentials, or other settings.

### 3\. What languages does Lambda support?

Lambda natively supports Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, C#, and PowerShell. This means we can write our Lambda functions directly in these languages without additional setup.

Additionally, Lambda allows us to use custom runtimes, providing the flexibility to package our function code and dependencies in a container image. This enables support for virtually any programming language, allowing us to choose the tool that best suits our needs.


### 5\. What are the different ways to invoke a Lambda Function?

We can invoke Lambda functions in several ways:

1.  **Synchronous invocation:** The client waits for the function to complete and return a response.
2.  **Asynchronous invocation:** The client doesn't wait for a response---Lambda executes the function in the background.
3.  **Event source mapping:** Lambda automatically polls services like DynamoDB or Kinesis and invokes functions based on events.
4.  **Other methods:** These include API Gateway, AWS SDKs, or scheduled invocations via Amazon EventBridge.


Intermediate AWS Lambda Interview Questions
-------------------------------------------

### 1\. How can we deploy dependencies alongside Lambda code?

There are a few options for packaging dependencies with Lambda code:

-   **Direct inclusion:** For interpreted languages, we can put dependency files along with our function code in the .zip deployment package.
-   **Lambda layers:** For compiled languages or larger dependencies, we can use Lambda layers to separately package and share common dependencies across functions.
-   **Container images:** We can also package dependencies in container images along with the Lambda function code and a custom runtime.

### 2\. How can we optimize the performance of Lambda functions?

We have several options to optimize Lambda functions:

1.  **Memory allocation:** Choosing the right memory size is crucial for balancing cost and performance. Tools like AWS Lambda Power Tuning can help find the optimal configuration.
2.  **Package size:** Smaller function packages lead to faster cold starts (the time it takes for a Lambda function to initialize on its first invocation). Minimize package size by removing unnecessary dependencies and compressing code.
3.  **Lambda SnapStart:** This feature pre-initializes function environments, significantly reducing cold start times for specific runtimes.
4.  **Provisioned concurrency:** Configure provisioned concurrency to keep function instances warm, ensuring consistent response times for critical workloads.
5.  **Timeouts and concurrency limits:** Set appropriate timeouts and reserved concurrency to prevent runaway functions and maintain a stable Lambda environment.

### 3\. What tools can you use to monitor and debug Lambda functions?

Lambda automatically sends metrics to **Amazon CloudWatch,** including number of requests, latency, error rates, and more.

We can use **CloudWatch Logs** to access logs that our function code and the Lambda runtime generate.

For tracing and troubleshooting the performance of distributed Lambda applications, we can use **AWS X-Ray.**

### 4\. What are Lambda extensions used for?

Lambda extensions enable us to enhance our functions by integrating with monitoring, observability, security, and governance tools.

Extensions can run as separate processes in the execution environment to capture diagnostic information or send data to custom destinations.

Examples include the Datadog extension for metrics and traces, and the AWS AppConfig extension for dynamic configuration updates.

### 5\. What is an event source mapping?

An event source mapping is a Lambda resource that reads items from an event source and invokes a function.

We can use event source mappings to process items from Amazon DynamoDB streams, Amazon Kinesis streams, Amazon MQ queues, self-managed Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS queues, and more.

Lambda provides a polling mechanism to read batches of records from the event sources and invoke a function.

Advanced AWS Lambda Interview Questions
---------------------------------------

### 1\. How do you control access to Lambda functions?

AWS Lambda uses IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control access at two levels:

-   **Resource-based policies** specify which AWS accounts, services, and resources are allowed to invoke the function.
-   The function's **execution role** determines what AWS services and resources the function code can access. Following the principle of least privilege, these policies should be as restrictive as possible while still allowing the function to perform its intended tasks.

### 2\. How can you minimize cold starts in Lambda?

Cold starts occur when Lambda needs to initialize a new execution environment to process an invocation request. To minimize cold starts and improve our Lambda function's responsiveness, we can employ several strategies:

1.  **Utilize SnapStart:** This feature (available for certain runtimes) allows us to persist initialized environments, significantly reducing startup times for subsequent invocations.
2.  **Enable provisioned concurrency:** By keeping a pool of initialized environments ready, we can eliminate cold starts for predictable workloads.
3.  **Optimize package size:** Reducing the size of our function package by removing unnecessary dependencies and optimizing code can accelerate the initialization process.
4.  **Language choice:** Opting for languages like Go or Rust, known for faster startup times than JVM languages, can also help mitigate cold start delays.
5.  **Execution context reuse:** Keeping our Lambda function code separate from the initial setup logic allows us to reuse the execution context between invocations, further reducing overhead.

Excellent summary, Rahman! You’ve captured the key points well. Let's break this down even further with **details**, **real-world impact**, and **exam-focused power-ups** to strengthen your understanding.

---

## ✅ What Is a Cold Start in Lambda?

A **cold start** happens when AWS:

1. Needs to spin up a **new container** to run your function.
2. Initializes the **runtime** and **your function code**.
3. Then finally runs the **handler**.

It usually occurs when:

* There are **no warm instances** of your function
* You deploy a new version
* You increase traffic suddenly (scale-out)

---

## ✅ 5 Proven Ways to Minimize Cold Starts

### 1. **AWS Lambda SnapStart** *(Java only for now)*

* SnapStart **restores a pre-initialized snapshot** of the runtime, drastically reducing startup time.
* **Supported Runtimes**: Java 11 (Amazon Corretto)

✅ Use when: You’re using Java and want the best startup performance
🔸 Savings: \~10x reduction in cold start time for Java

---

### 2. **Provisioned Concurrency** 🔥

* Keeps a **pre-warmed pool** of Lambda instances **always ready** to serve requests.
* Removes cold starts entirely for those pre-warmed invocations.

```yaml
# serverless.yml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    provisionedConcurrency: 2
```

✅ Use when: You have **predictable traffic** (e.g., login service, payment flow)
🔸 Cost: You pay for the provisioned time even if no invocations happen

---

### 3. **Optimize Your Deployment Package**

* Reduce `node_modules`, tree-shake unused code
* Don’t bundle giant libraries unless needed
* Consider layers for shared dependencies

✅ Use when: Your function's deployment size is slowing cold starts
🔸 Tip: Try esbuild or SWC with Serverless Framework for minimal packages

---

### 4. **Use a Language with Low Startup Latency**

| Language | Cold Start Time (avg)       |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Go       | ✅ Fastest                   |
| Node.js  | ✅ Fast                      |
| Python   | ✅ Fast                      |
| Java     | ⚠️ Slow (without SnapStart) |
| .NET     | ⚠️ Moderate                 |

✅ Use when: You’re choosing a new runtime for performance-sensitive apps

---

### 5. **Reuse Execution Context**

* Define **connections and variables outside the handler**
* AWS reuses the **same container** for multiple invocations (warm starts)

```js
// Avoid reconnecting DB on every run
const db = connectToDB();

exports.handler = async () => {
  const result = await db.query("SELECT * FROM table");
  return result;
};
```

✅ Use when: You want to optimize warm-start performance and reduce setup cost

---

## 🧠 Exam Power-Up (Memory Trick):

> **"PSLOE"** = **Provisioned, SnapStart, Lightweight code, Optimal language, Execution context**

---

## ✅ Sample Exam Question

**Q: You have a latency-sensitive function written in Node.js that experiences unpredictable cold starts. What’s the BEST way to reduce the impact of cold starts?**

A. Use a smaller memory size
B. Enable SnapStart
C. Use provisioned concurrency
D. Switch to Java

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

---


### 3\. What are some common API security best practices for Lambda?

When exposing Lambda functions via API Gateway, some security best practices include:

-   Using IAM or Lambda authorizers to authenticate and authorize requests.
-   Enabling Amazon Cognito user pools for user management.
-   Defining resource policies to allow or deny access based on request properties like source IPs.
-   Setting up mTLS for secure client-server communication.
-   Using AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits targeting APIs.


Great question, Rahman — this one is often tested in the AWS Developer Associate (DVA-C02) exam. Let’s compare **Lambda container images** vs **.zip deployment packages** so you know **when to use which**.

---

## ✅ 1. Lambda Zip Deployment Package

### 🔹 What is it?

The **traditional** way to deploy Lambda. You package your code and dependencies into a `.zip` file and upload it.

### 🔹 Limits:

* Max size: **50 MB zipped** (direct upload), **250 MB unzipped** (when using S3)
* Runtime is managed by AWS (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.)
* Fast cold starts for smaller packages

### 🔹 Use When:

* Your codebase is small to medium
* You’re using standard AWS runtimes (Node.js, Python, etc.)
* Simplicity and fast deploys are important

### 🔹 Example:

```bash
zip function.zip index.js node_modules/
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name my-function --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

---

## ✅ 2. Lambda Container Image

### 🔹 What is it?

A **Docker image** (based on Amazon Linux 2 or custom base images) that packages everything — including OS-level dependencies.

### 🔹 Limits:

* Max size: **10 GB**
* Must be stored in **Amazon ECR**
* Custom runtime and native dependencies supported

### 🔹 Use When:

* You have **large applications or libraries**
* You need **native binaries**, libraries like Puppeteer, OpenCV, Pandas, etc.
* You want **full control** over the runtime
* You need to **standardize environments** across Lambda and ECS/EKS

### 🔹 Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs20.x

COPY app.js package.json ./

RUN npm install

CMD [ "app.handler" ]
```

Then:

```bash
docker build -t my-lambda .
docker tag my-lambda:latest <your-ecr-repo>
docker push <your-ecr-repo>
```

---

## ✅ Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                    | `.zip` Package                   | Container Image                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Size Limit**             | 50 MB zipped / 250 MB unzipped   | 10 GB                               |
| **Upload**                 | Inline or from S3                | From Amazon ECR                     |
| **Custom Dependencies**    | Limited to language runtime      | Full control (OS, native binaries)  |
| **Cold Start**             | Faster for small zips            | Slower for large images             |
| **Custom Runtime Support** | Via Lambda Layers or Runtime API | Fully customizable                  |
| **Deployment Speed**       | Faster                           | Slower (due to Docker build + push) |
| **Tools Needed**           | AWS CLI or Serverless Framework  | Docker + ECR + CLI                  |

---

## 🧠 Exam Power-Up (Memory Trick):

> Use **Zip** for speed and simplicity.
> Use **Container** for size, control, or native dependencies.

---

## ✅ Sample Exam Question:

**Q: Which of the following is a reason to choose a container image over a .zip package for deploying a Lambda function?**

A. You want faster cold starts
B. You need to include a 700 MB native dependency
C. You want to deploy from GitHub
D. You don’t want to use Amazon ECR

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why?** Only container images allow Lambda functions up to **10 GB**, which supports large native dependencies.

---
Perfect, Rahman! Let’s walk through **how to deploy a Lambda function using a Docker container image** with **Amazon ECR** and the **Serverless Framework** step-by-step.

---

## ✅ Goal

We’ll build and deploy a simple Lambda function using:

* A **custom Dockerfile**
* **Amazon ECR** for storing the image
* **Serverless Framework** for deployment

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide

### 🔹 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Docker
* Serverless Framework (v3+)
* AWS CLI (configured)
* `pnpm` or `npm` (your choice)

---

### 🔹 2. Create Project Folder

```bash
mkdir lambda-container-example && cd lambda-container-example
```

---

### 🔹 3. Create a Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs20.x

# Copy code
COPY app.js ./

# Set the CMD to your handler function
CMD [ "app.handler" ]
```

---

### 🔹 4. Write the Lambda Code (`app.js`)

```js
// app.js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from Docker Lambda!" }),
  };
};
```

---

### 🔹 5. Create `serverless.yml`

```yaml
service: docker-lambda-demo

frameworkVersion: '3'

provider:
  name: aws
  ecr:
    images:
      myfunction:
        path: .    # where the Dockerfile is

functions:
  hello:
    image:
      name: myfunction
```

---

### 🔹 6. Deploy!

```bash
pnpx serverless deploy
```

Serverless Framework will:

* Build the Docker image using your `Dockerfile`
* Push it to an auto-generated **ECR repository**
* Create the Lambda using the image
* Output the function’s ARN and status

---

### 🔹 7. Test It

```bash
pnpx serverless invoke -f hello
```

Output:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"message\":\"Hello from Docker Lambda!\"}"
}
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tip

You can now:

* Add native binaries or modules in the Dockerfile (e.g. Puppeteer, FFmpeg)
* Use `.env` files for secrets
* Add custom layers or AWS SDKs
* Standardize the image across Lambda and ECS

---
5. Can Lambda functions call other Lambda functions?
Yes, Lambda functions can invoke other functions directly using the AWS SDK. Common use cases include function orchestration, aggregating results from multiple functions, and fanning out event processing.

When a Lambda function invokes another, the invoked function's resource-based policy should explicitly grant access to allow invocation from the calling function.

That’s absolutely correct, Rahman — and this topic often shows up in real-world systems and the **AWS Developer Associate exam**. Let’s go deeper into:

---

## ✅ Can Lambda Functions Call Other Lambda Functions?

**Yes**, Lambda functions **can call each other** using the **AWS SDK** — either synchronously or asynchronously.

---

### ✅ Common Use Cases

| Use Case                      | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Function Orchestration**    | One function controls the workflow of multiple downstream functions (can use Step Functions too) |
| **Fan-out Pattern**           | One function calls multiple others in parallel (e.g., process image, send email, log)            |
| **Microservices Interaction** | A Lambda invokes another Lambda acting as a microservice endpoint                                |
| **Aggregation**               | A Lambda gathers data from other Lambdas, APIs, or services and combines the response            |

---

## ✅ Example: Call Another Lambda Using AWS SDK v3 (Node.js)

Let’s say `FunctionA` calls `FunctionB`.

### 🔹 `FunctionA` Code

```js
// functionA.js
const { LambdaClient, InvokeCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lambda");

const lambda = new LambdaClient({ region: "ap-southeast-2" });

exports.handler = async () => {
  const params = {
    FunctionName: "FunctionB",
    InvocationType: "RequestResponse", // Or 'Event' for async
    Payload: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ message: "Hi from A" })),
  };

  const response = await lambda.send(new InvokeCommand(params));
  const result = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(response.Payload).toString());

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ result }),
  };
};
```

---

## ✅ Lambda Invocation Types

| Type             | InvocationType      | Behavior                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Synchronous**  | `"RequestResponse"` | Caller waits for response     |
| **Asynchronous** | `"Event"`           | Fire and forget               |
| **Dry Run**      | `"DryRun"`          | Used to test permissions only |

---

## ✅ IAM Permissions (Resource-Based Policy)

For `FunctionA` to call `FunctionB`, **FunctionB must allow it** in its permissions.

You can add a resource-based policy to FunctionB like:

```bash
aws lambda add-permission \
  --function-name FunctionB \
  --principal lambda.amazonaws.com \
  --action lambda:InvokeFunction \
  --statement-id allowFunctionA \
  --source-arn arn:aws:lambda:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:function:FunctionA
```

This ensures that FunctionB trusts FunctionA to invoke it.

---

## ✅ Serverless Framework Example

```yaml
functions:
  functionA:
    handler: functionA.handler
    environment:
      FUNC_B_NAME: functionB

  functionB:
    handler: functionB.handler
    name: functionB  # fixed name to allow referencing
```

---

## ✅ Sample Exam Question

**Q: How can a Lambda function invoke another Lambda function securely?**

A. Enable VPC peering between functions
B. Use Amazon S3 to transfer requests
C. Grant `lambda:InvokeFunction` in the target function's resource policy
D. Enable X-Ray on both functions

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

Practical AWS Lambda Interview Questions
----------------------------------------

### 1\. How do you implement a simple REST API using Lambda and API Gateway?

We can implement a simple REST API using Lambda and API Gateway by taking the following steps:

1.  **Create** **a Lambda function: Develop a Lambda function that receives input from API Gateway as an event object and returns a response object with data and status codes.**
2.  **Create an API Gateway**: In the API Gateway, we create a new REST API with a resource and method corresponding to the API path and the HTTP method.
3.  **Configure the integration**: We configure the method's integration type as Lambda proxy and specify the function to invoke
4.  **Deploy the API**: Deploy the API to generate a public URL endpoint for access.
5.  **Test thoroughly:** We can use tools like cURL or Postman to ensure the API functions correctly, with the Lambda function handling requests and returning appropriate responses.

### 2\. How do you configure a Lambda function to process events from an S3 bucket?

We can configure a Lambda function to process events from an S3 bucket by taking the steps below:

1.  We create a Lambda function with the appropriate permissions to access the S3 bucket.
2.  In the S3 console, we configure an event notification on the source bucket.
3.  We choose the event types to trigger the notification, such as object creation or deletion.
4.  We specify the Lambda function as the notification destination.
5.  We test by performing actions on the S3 bucket that match the configured event types.
6.  We verify that the Lambda function is invoked with an event containing details of the S3 action.

### 3\. How do you configure a Lambda function to write data to a DynamoDB table?

We can configure a Lambda function to write data to a DynamoDB table by performing these six steps:

1.  We create a DynamoDB table with an appropriate primary key and any required secondary indexes.
2.  We create an IAM role for the Lambda function with permissions to access DynamoDB.
3.  We create a Lambda function and attach the IAM role.
4.  We use the DynamoDB SDK to create a client instance with the table name.
5.  We use the `put_item` method to write items to the table, specifying the key attributes and other fields.
6.  Test the function with sample events and use DynamoDB queries to verify data is written correctly.

### 4\. How do you implement a scheduled Lambda function?

We can implement a scheduled Lambda function by taking these steps--we:

1.  Create a Lambda function to perform the desired task on a schedule.
2.  Open the Amazon EventBridge console and create a new rule.
3.  Define a schedule expression for the rule using rate or cron syntax.
4.  Select the Lambda function as a target for the rule.
5.  Save the rule and test by waiting for the next scheduled event.
6.  Verify the function's execution in CloudWatch metrics and logs.

### 5\. How do you gradually shift traffic to a new version of a Lambda function?

To shift traffic to a new version of a Lambda function, we:

1.  Publish a new version of the Lambda function with the updated code.
2.  Create an alias that points to the older stable version.
3.  Update the alias to split traffic between the old and new versions using weights (e.g., 90/10).
4.  Gradually adjust the weights to shift more traffic to the new version while monitoring metrics.
5.  Once satisfied, update the alias to send 100% of the traffic to the new version.
6.  Repeat the process for the next function update, treating the previous version as the new stable version.



### 6\. How do you handle a long running task in AWS Lambda?

Excellent question, Rahman — long-running tasks in serverless architecture require a different strategy because AWS Lambda has **a hard timeout limit of 15 minutes**.

Here’s a detailed look at **how to handle long-running tasks in serverless computing** effectively:

---

## ✅ Problem:

Lambda is **not designed** for tasks that:

* Run longer than **15 minutes**
* Require **streaming** or **chunked** processing
* Need **manual user input** in between steps

---

## ✅ Strategies to Handle Long-Running Tasks

### 1. **Break into Smaller Steps with Step Functions**

> The most common AWS-native solution

* Use **AWS Step Functions** to **split the long task** into multiple Lambda executions.
* Each Lambda handles a part of the task, runs under 15 min, then passes state to the next.
* Supports retry logic, error handling, parallelism, human-in-the-loop.

**Example:** Transcoding a video → Step 1: Upload → Step 2: Validate → Step 3: Convert → Step 4: Notify

```yaml
StartAt: ValidateUpload
States:
  ValidateUpload:
    Type: Task
    Resource: arn:aws:lambda:...
    Next: ConvertVideo
  ConvertVideo:
    Type: Task
    Resource: arn:aws:lambda:...
    End: true
```

✅ **Best For**: Workflows, retries, progress monitoring
🧠 *Exam tip: Step Functions = orchestration for serverless*

---

### 2. **Use SQS or EventBridge to Queue and Fan Out Work**

* Break task into chunks (e.g., process 1K records at a time)
* Push each chunk into an **SQS queue**
* A Lambda triggers from the queue and processes each chunk individually

✅ **Best For**: Batch processing, background jobs
🧠 *SQS decouples producers and consumers = scalable & resilient*

---

### 3. **Offload to Fargate for Long Jobs**

If a task **cannot** be broken into smaller chunks or needs longer compute time:

* Use **AWS Fargate** (container-based serverless) with ECS to run jobs that take hours
* Trigger a **Fargate task** from Lambda

✅ **Best For**: CPU/GPU-intensive tasks like ML training, large file processing
🧠 *Fargate supports full OS access, memory scaling, long runtimes*

---

### 4. **Async Invocation + Status Check**

* Invoke Lambda **asynchronously**
* Immediately return a `taskId`
* Client uses another endpoint (`GET /status/:taskId`) to **poll for completion**

✅ **Best For**: Client-triggered tasks needing confirmation
🧠 *Separate invoke from status-checking to avoid holding connections open*

---

### 5. **Store Intermediate State in DynamoDB or S3**

When a long-running task has checkpoints (e.g., process page 1, then 2):

* Store current progress in **DynamoDB or S3**
* Resume later Lambda invocation using that state

✅ **Best For**: Resumable tasks, checkpointed processing

---

## 🚫 What Not to Do:

* ❌ Don't try to keep Lambda alive with `setInterval` or infinite loops
* ❌ Don't break the 15-minute hard limit
* ❌ Don't assume warm containers = persistent state

---

## ✅ Sample Exam Question

**Q: Your image-processing application receives large video files that take 20 minutes to convert. Which is the best solution in a serverless architecture?**

A. Increase Lambda timeout
B. Split video and process chunks in Lambda
C. Use AWS Step Functions with multiple Lambda steps
D. Use Lambda with provisioned concurrency

**✅ Correct Answer: C**

---

Would you like to build a real-world example using **Step Functions** to orchestrate multiple Lambdas as a long-running job?


Great question, Rahman — this is **exactly the kind of nuance** that shows up in **real-world performance planning** and AWS certification exams.

Let’s clarify what happens when you configure **Provisioned Concurrency = 5** and then receive **10 concurrent requests**.

---

## ✅ Behavior: Provisioned Concurrency vs. Auto Scaling

### ⚙️ If You Set:

```yaml
provisionedConcurrency: 5
```

Then Lambda **pre-warms 5 containers** that are always ready to serve **with zero cold start**.

---

## 🔥 What Happens When 10 Requests Come In?

### ➤ **First 5 requests**:

* Immediately served by the 5 provisioned instances (zero cold start)

### ➤ **Next 5 requests**:

It depends on your overall **concurrency configuration**:

---

### ✅ Scenario 1: **No Reserved Concurrency**

* Remaining 5 requests will be handled by **on-demand (unreserved) concurrency**
* Lambda will **scale automatically**, but those new instances **might experience cold starts**
* So yes, you can go beyond 5 — but with potential cold starts

✅ **Summary**:
**Yes, it will auto-scale.** Provisioned concurrency only guarantees the first 5 are always warm — the rest fall back to regular auto-scaling Lambda behavior.

---

### 🔒 Scenario 2: **You Set Reserved Concurrency = 5**

```bash
aws lambda put-function-concurrency \
  --function-name my-function \
  --reserved-concurrent-executions 5
```

Then Lambda will **hard cap** concurrency at 5:

* Request 6 and onward will be **throttled**
* No auto-scaling will happen beyond 5

🚫 In this case: You **won’t** serve more than 5 concurrent requests.

---

### ⚠️ Important Distinction

| Feature                     | Auto-scales? | Cold-start free? | Hard Cap? |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | --------- |
| **Provisioned Concurrency** | ✅ (after 5)  | ✅ (for 5)        | ❌         |
| **Reserved Concurrency**    | ❌ (capped)   | ❌                | ✅         |
