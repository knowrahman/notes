### What Is Unit Testing?

A **unit test** is a piece of code that tests a small, isolated piece (a *unit*) of your application, typically a method or function, to ensure it behaves as expected.

---

### Benefits of Unit Testing

- Catches bugs early in development
- Makes code easier to refactor
- Serves as documentation for how the code works
- Encourages writing loosely coupled, testable code

---

### Unit Testing Frameworks in .NET

1. **xUnit** – modern, widely used
2. **NUnit** – similar to JUnit, very popular
3. **MSTest** – built into Visual Studio

Let’s go with **xUnit** (preferred by the .NET community).

---

### Getting Started with xUnit

**1. Install the xUnit NuGet package:**

```bash
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package xunit.runner.visualstudio
dotnet add package Moq
```

---

### Sample Class to Test

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
    public int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;
}
```

---

### Writing a Unit Test with xUnit

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class CalculatorTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        var calc = new Calculator();

        // Act
        var result = calc.Add(2, 3);

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(5, result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Multiply_ShouldReturnCorrectProduct()
    {
        var calc = new Calculator();
        var result = calc.Multiply(4, 5);
        Assert.Equal(20, result);
    }
}
```

---

### Running the Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

---

### What is the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern?

The **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern is a simple and effective way to structure unit tests. It divides the test into three distinct parts:

- **Arrange**: You prepare the necessary objects, variables, or data needed for the test.
- **Act**: You perform the operation or method call that you want to test.
- **Assert**: You verify that the result is what you expect.

### Example

Here’s an example of a unit test that uses this pattern with a simple `Calculator` class:

#### Calculator Class

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
}
```

#### Test Case Using Arrange-Act-Assert

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class CalculatorTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnSumOfTwoNumbers()
    {
        // Arrange
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        int a = 5;
        int b = 7;

        // Act
        int result = calculator.Add(a, b);

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(12, result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Arrange**: We set up the `calculator` object and initialized the values `a = 5` and `b = 7`.
- **Act**: We invoked the `Add` method to compute the sum.
- **Assert**: We checked that the result equals the expected value `12`.

> **Note:** Unit tests are designed to verify that a function or method produces the expected output for a given input. The focus is not on how the function works internally but on its observable behavior, which allows you to confidently test and refactor code without breaking existing functionality.



### String Test Example in Unit Testing & Fluent Assertion

Let’s assume you have a class that performs string manipulations, such as trimming whitespaces and checking if a string contains certain characters.

#### Example String Method

```csharp
public class StringHelper
{
    public string TrimWhitespace(string input)
    {
        return input.Trim();
    }

    public bool ContainsWord(string input, string word)
    {
        return input.Contains(word);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `TrimWhitespace`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string.
- `ContainsWord`: Checks if a word exists within a string.

### Unit Test Without FluentAssertions

Here’s how we could write basic unit tests for these methods using **xUnit** and the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class StringHelperTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void TrimWhitespace_ShouldRemoveLeadingAndTrailingSpaces()
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new StringHelper();
        string input = "  Hello World  ";

        // Act
        string result = helper.TrimWhitespace(input);

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal("Hello World", result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void ContainsWord_ShouldReturnTrueWhenWordExists()
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new StringHelper();
        string input = "Hello, world!";
        string word = "world";

        // Act
        bool result = helper.ContainsWord(input, word);

        // Assert
        Assert.True(result);
    }
}
```

These tests verify that:
1. The whitespace is trimmed correctly from the input string.
2. The `ContainsWord` method correctly checks if the word exists in the input string.

---

### Using FluentAssertions

**FluentAssertions** is a library that provides more expressive and readable assertions. It allows you to write assertions in a more human-readable format.

#### Adding FluentAssertions

First, install **FluentAssertions** via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package FluentAssertions
```

Now, let’s rewrite the same tests using **FluentAssertions**.

#### Refactored Unit Tests with FluentAssertions

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;

public class StringHelperTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void TrimWhitespace_ShouldRemoveLeadingAndTrailingSpaces()
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new StringHelper();
        string input = "  Hello World  ";

        // Act
        string result = helper.TrimWhitespace(input);

        // Assert
        result.Should().Be("Hello World");
    }

    [Fact]
    public void ContainsWord_ShouldReturnTrueWhenWordExists()
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new StringHelper();
        string input = "Hello, world!";
        string word = "world";

        // Act
        bool result = helper.ContainsWord(input, word);

        // Assert
        result.Should().BeTrue();
    }
}
```

### Why Use FluentAssertions?

1. **More Readable**: The syntax is easier to read and understand, making tests look closer to natural language. For example, `result.Should().Be("Hello World")` is more expressive than `Assert.Equal("Hello World", result)`.

2. **Better Error Messages**: When a test fails, FluentAssertions provides more descriptive error messages, making it easier to identify what went wrong.

3. **Advanced Features**: FluentAssertions supports a wide range of assertions like checking collections, exceptions, and more. For example, it supports `BeNull`, `BeEmpty`, `HaveCount`, `Contain`, etc.

#### Example of Advanced Assertions

```csharp
public void ShouldContainWordAndHaveCorrectLength()
{
    // Arrange
    var helper = new StringHelper();
    string input = "Hello, world!";

    // Act
    bool result = helper.ContainsWord(input, "world");

    // Assert
    result.Should().BeTrue();
    input.Should().Contain("world");
    input.Length.Should().BeGreaterThan(10);
}
```

This example demonstrates multiple assertions for the same string, and all of them use FluentAssertions.

---

### Summary

- **Unit Test**: You test a string manipulation method by verifying if it behaves as expected for different inputs.
- **FluentAssertions**: Makes the assertions more readable and provides better error messages. It’s a helpful tool for writing clean, expressive tests.


In xUnit, **Theory** and **InlineData** are used together to write **parameterized tests**, which allow the same test to be executed multiple times with different sets of data. This helps to reduce repetitive code and test various input scenarios with minimal effort.

### Theory Attribute

The `Theory` attribute in xUnit is used to mark a test method as a parameterized test. This means the same test logic will be run with different sets of data. Instead of writing multiple tests for similar functionality, you can provide various input values and expected outputs, and xUnit will run the test for each combination.

### InlineData Attribute

The `InlineData` attribute is used to provide specific data sets for the test method marked with the `Theory` attribute. Each `InlineData` attribute represents one set of input parameters that will be passed into the test method.

### Example with Theory and InlineData Using FluentAssertions

Let’s use an example with the `IsEven` method that checks if a number is even or odd.

#### Method Under Test

```csharp
public class NumberHelper
{
    public bool IsEven(int number)
    {
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

#### Unit Test with Theory and InlineData

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;

public class NumberHelperTests
{
    [Theory]
    [InlineData(2, true)]   // Tests if 2 is even
    [InlineData(4, true)]   // Tests if 4 is even
    [InlineData(5, false)]  // Tests if 5 is odd
    [InlineData(7, false)]  // Tests if 7 is odd
    public void IsEven_ShouldReturnCorrectResult(int number, bool expectedResult)
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new NumberHelper();

        // Act
        bool result = helper.IsEven(number);

        // Assert
        result.Should().Be(expectedResult);
    }
}
```

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;

public class StringValidatorTests
{
    [Theory]
    [InlineData("test@example.com", true)]
    [InlineData("invalid-email", false)]
    [InlineData("another.test@domain.com", true)]
    [InlineData("not@valid", true)]
    public void IsValidEmail_ShouldReturnCorrectResult(string email, bool expectedResult)
    {
        // Arrange
        var validator = new StringValidator();

        // Act
        bool result = validator.IsValidEmail(email);

        // Assert
        result.Should().Be(expectedResult);
    }
}

```


### Explanation of the Code

- **Theory**: The `Theory` attribute tells xUnit that the test method is a parameterized test. The test method will run once for each set of data provided by the `InlineData` attributes.
  
- **InlineData**: Each `InlineData` attribute provides a set of parameters for the test method. In this example:
  - `InlineData(2, true)` runs the test with `2` as the input and `true` as the expected result (because 2 is even).
  - `InlineData(5, false)` runs the test with `5` as the input and `false` as the expected result (because 5 is odd).

- **FluentAssertions**: We use `result.Should().Be(expectedResult)` for a clear and readable assertion. If the result is not equal to the expected result, FluentAssertions will provide a more descriptive error message.

### Benefits of Using Theory and InlineData

1. **Reduce Test Duplication**: Instead of writing separate test methods for each input, you can use `Theory` and `InlineData` to run the same test logic with different inputs and expected outcomes.
  
2. **Clearer Tests**: The data is clearly defined with `InlineData`, making the test cases more concise and easier to understand.

3. **Better Test Coverage**: You can easily test multiple scenarios with minimal code.

### When to Use Theory and InlineData

- When you want to run the same test logic with multiple sets of input data.
- When the behavior of the method you're testing is predictable for different sets of input (like mathematical operations or string manipulations).
- When you want to test edge cases or specific input combinations without writing redundant code.

---

In unit testing, it's often a good practice to minimize duplication, especially for setting up the **System Under Test (SUT)**. Instead of repeating the same object instantiation logic in each individual test, you can handle the setup in a centralized way.

One common approach is to instantiate the **SUT** in the **constructor** of the test class, which makes it available for all the test methods without needing to repeat the setup in each individual test. This helps to keep the tests clean and focused on the actual logic being tested.

### Example: Instantiating the SUT in the Constructor

Let’s say we are testing a class `Calculator` with methods like `Add` and `Multiply`. Instead of creating a new instance of `Calculator` in each test method, we can instantiate it once in the constructor of the test class.

#### Calculator Class

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }

    public int Multiply(int x, int y)
    {
        return x * y;
    }
}
```

#### Test Class with SUT Instantiated in Constructor

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;

public class CalculatorTests
{
    private readonly Calculator _calculator;

    // Constructor that initializes the SUT (Calculator) once
    public CalculatorTests()
    {
        _calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
    {
        // Act
        int result = _calculator.Add(2, 3);

        // Assert
        result.Should().Be(5);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Multiply_ShouldReturnCorrectProduct()
    {
        // Act
        int result = _calculator.Multiply(4, 5);

        // Assert
        result.Should().Be(20);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **SUT Instantiated in Constructor**: 
  - The `Calculator` instance is created in the constructor (`CalculatorTests()`), and it’s shared across all test methods. This eliminates the need to instantiate the `Calculator` object in each individual test.
  
- **Private Field for SUT**: 
  - We store the `Calculator` instance in a private field (`_calculator`) so it can be used by all the test methods.
  
- **Test Methods**: 
  - Each test method, like `Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum` and `Multiply_ShouldReturnCorrectProduct`, simply uses the `_calculator` instance without needing to create a new one.
  
### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reduce Redundancy**: By instantiating the SUT in the constructor, you avoid redundant object creation in each test, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
  
2. **Improves Readability**: The test methods focus on the test logic itself, not on setup and object instantiation.
  
3. **Faster Execution**: If the SUT creation is resource-intensive (for example, involves a database connection or expensive operations), doing it once in the constructor can make tests faster.

4. **Easier to Maintain**: If the setup changes (e.g., you need to inject a dependency or use a different configuration), you only need to modify the constructor, not every test method.

### Alternative with Setup Method (for Additional Setup)

In some cases, you may want to perform additional setup steps for each test. You can use the `IClassFixture<T>` or `ITestOutputHelper` interfaces if needed, but for the basic case where you only need to instantiate the SUT, the constructor approach is clean and effective.

### Conclusion

- By instantiating the **SUT** in the constructor of the test class, you ensure that it is available for all tests without the need for repetitive setup in each individual test method.
- This improves code maintainability, test readability, and reduces unnecessary duplication.


### Unit Testing `DateTime` and Objects

Unit testing `DateTime`, **objects**, and **IEnumerables of objects** involves checking whether the code behaves correctly when dealing with dates, objects, and collections. For all these scenarios, using **FluentAssertions** (with the `Be` and `Of` methods) helps make the tests more readable and expressive.

### 1. **Unit Testing DateTime**

When testing `DateTime`, the challenges come from the fact that the current date and time are always changing. To ensure consistent tests, you can use a fixed date or mock the current time.

#### Example 1: Testing DateTime with FluentAssertions

Let’s say you have a method that checks if a given date is today.

##### Method Under Test

```csharp
public class DateHelper
{
    public bool IsToday(DateTime date)
    {
        return date.Date == DateTime.Now.Date;
    }
}
```

#### Unit Test Using `Be`

To make the test deterministic, you'd want to use a fixed date (mocking `DateTime.Now`) or a date that doesn't change during the test.

##### Test Class

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;
using System;

public class DateHelperTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void IsToday_ShouldReturnTrueForToday()
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new DateHelper();
        DateTime today = DateTime.Now.Date;  // Ensure today is consistent

        // Act
        bool result = helper.IsToday(today);

        // Assert
        result.Should().BeTrue();  // Checking if the result matches the expected value
    }

    [Fact]
    public void IsToday_ShouldReturnFalseForAnotherDay()
    {
        // Arrange
        var helper = new DateHelper();
        DateTime yesterday = DateTime.Now.Date.AddDays(-1);

        // Act
        bool result = helper.IsToday(yesterday);

        // Assert
        result.Should().BeFalse();  // Assert that the method returns false for a different day
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **`.Be(expected)`**: This is used when you expect a specific value (e.g., `true` or `false`).
- **`.Date`**: Ensure you’re comparing only the date part of `DateTime` to ignore time differences.

### 2. **Unit Testing Objects**

When testing methods that return objects, you'll need to check if an object matches the expected values or properties. This can be done using **FluentAssertions**.

#### Example 2: Testing an Object

Let’s say you have a `Person` object with properties `Name` and `Age`.

##### Method Under Test

```csharp
public class PersonService
{
    public Person GetPerson()
    {
        return new Person
        {
            Name = "John Doe",
            Age = 30
        };
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

#### Unit Test for Object Comparison

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;

public class PersonServiceTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void GetPerson_ShouldReturnCorrectPerson()
    {
        // Arrange
        var service = new PersonService();

        // Act
        var person = service.GetPerson();

        // Assert
        person.Name.Should().Be("John Doe");   // Check Name
        person.Age.Should().Be(30);             // Check Age
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **`.Be(expected)`**: You can use `.Be(expected)` to verify that a property on an object has the correct value (like `Name` and `Age`).
- **Object Comparison**: You can verify multiple properties of an object in a single test.

---

### 3. **Unit Testing IEnumerables of Objects**

When you are working with collections of objects (like `List<T>` or `IEnumerable<T>`), you need to ensure that the collection contains the expected items, and sometimes that the items are in the correct order.

#### Example 3: Testing IEnumerables of Objects

Let’s assume you have a service that returns a list of `Person` objects.

##### Method Under Test

```csharp
public class PersonService
{
    public IEnumerable<Person> GetAllPeople()
    {
        return new List<Person>
        {
            new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 },
            new Person { Name = "Jane", Age = 25 }
        };
    }
}
```

#### Unit Test for IEnumerables

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;
using System.Linq;

public class PersonServiceTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void GetAllPeople_ShouldReturnCorrectPeople()
    {
        // Arrange
        var service = new PersonService();

        // Act
        var people = service.GetAllPeople();

        // Assert
        people.Should().HaveCount(2);                          // Check that the list has 2 elements
        people.First().Name.Should().Be("John");                // First person name
        people.Last().Age.Should().Be(25);                      // Last person's age
    }
}
```

#### Key Points:
- **`.HaveCount(expected)`**: This is used when you want to check how many elements are in a collection.
- **`.First()` and `.Last()`**: These can be used to access the first or last element of a collection.
- **`.Be(expected)`**: This checks if individual properties of elements in the collection match the expected value.

### 4. **Using `Be` vs `Of`**

In FluentAssertions, **`Be`** and **`Of`** are used in different contexts.

- **`Be(expected)`**: This is used for exact equality checks. You would use it when you want to compare values or properties to exact expected values.

  - Example: `result.Should().Be(30);` (to check if the `Age` is 30)
  
- **`OfType<T>()`**: This is used when you want to check if a collection contains elements of a specific type.

  - Example: `people.Should().ContainItemsAssignableTo<Person>();` (check if all items in the collection are of type `Person`)

#### Example of Using `OfType`:

```csharp
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MixedTypeListTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void List_ShouldContainOnlyPersons()
    {
        // Arrange
        var items = new List<object> { new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 }, new Person { Name = "Jane", Age = 25 }, "Not a person" };

        // Act & Assert
        items.OfType<Person>().Should().HaveCount(2);  // Ensure there are 2 Person objects in the list
    }
}
```

In this example:
- **`.OfType<T>()`** is used to filter the collection to only items of type `Person`.
- **`.HaveCount(expected)`** ensures that there are exactly 2 `Person` objects in the list.

---

### Conclusion

- **`Be(expected)`** is used for exact value checks (e.g., matching a specific property or value).
- **`OfType<T>()`** is used when you need to assert the type of elements in a collection (like checking if items in a list are of a particular type).
- When unit testing `DateTime`, use specific dates to avoid issues with time-dependent values (e.g., using `.Date` to ignore the time part).
- **FluentAssertions** makes comparisons of objects and collections more expressive and readable by using methods like `.Be()`, `.HaveCount()`, and `.OfType()`.


### What is Mocking?

**Mocking** in unit testing refers to the practice of creating **mock objects** that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way. The main goal of mocking is to isolate the **System Under Test (SUT)** from external dependencies, so you can test the SUT’s behavior without needing to rely on real services, databases, or external APIs.

Mocking allows you to:

- **Simulate complex behaviors** without needing the actual implementation.
- **Test specific interactions** and make sure certain methods are called with the correct parameters.
- **Isolate the SUT** by replacing external dependencies with mocks to ensure the test is focused only on the logic of the SUT.

### Why Use Mocking?

In real-world applications, some components (like databases, APIs, or third-party services) can be slow, expensive, or difficult to test. Mocking enables you to simulate these dependencies, speeding up your tests and making them more focused.

### Moq Library

Moq is a popular mocking library for **.NET**. It is used to create mock objects for interfaces or abstract classes, and you can define behaviors and verify interactions with them. Moq provides an easy-to-use API to mock services, repositories, and other dependencies.

---

### Key Concepts in Mocking with Moq

1. **Mocking an Interface or Class**: You can mock any interface or virtual method of a class. Moq works by creating an in-memory mock object that implements the interface or abstract class.

2. **Setting up behavior**: You can configure the mock to return specific values when methods are called, throw exceptions, or track how the mock is used.

3. **Verifying interactions**: After calling the methods on the mock object, you can verify that the mock’s methods were called in the expected manner.

4. **Return Values**: Moq allows you to specify what value or behavior a mocked method should return when called. You can return constants, specific values, or even a sequence of values.

5. **Verify Method Calls**: You can verify if certain methods were called, how many times they were called, and with what parameters.

---

### Is an Interface Necessary to Mock a Service?

No, an interface is not strictly necessary for mocking a service, but it is common and a best practice. The reason is that interfaces (and abstract classes) allow for better flexibility and decoupling, which is the core principle behind **dependency injection** and **unit testing**. By mocking an interface, you isolate the behavior of the class being tested from its dependencies.

That said, **Moq** can also mock **virtual methods** or **abstract methods** in concrete classes, even if they don’t implement an interface. However, mocking interfaces is more common and recommended.

### Mocking a DB Repository - Real-World Example

Let’s consider a **repository** pattern that abstracts data access from the rest of the application. We’ll mock this repository to test a service that depends on it without needing a real database connection.

#### Scenario: A `UserService` that fetches users from a database

##### 1. **Repository Interface**

```csharp
public interface IUserRepository
{
    User GetUserById(int id);
    void AddUser(User user);
    IEnumerable<User> GetAllUsers();
}
```

This interface represents a repository that interacts with the database for CRUD operations.

##### 2. **UserService**

The `UserService` class depends on `IUserRepository` to fetch and add users.

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;

    public UserService(IUserRepository userRepository)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User GetUser(int id)
    {
        return _userRepository.GetUserById(id);
    }

    public IEnumerable<User> GetAllUsers()
    {
        return _userRepository.GetAllUsers();
    }

    public void AddUser(User user)
    {
        _userRepository.AddUser(user);
    }
}
```

Here, `UserService` interacts with the repository to get a user by ID, fetch all users, and add a new user.

##### 3. **Mocking the Repository with Moq**

To test `UserService`, we need to mock the `IUserRepository` interface.

```csharp
using Moq;
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class UserServiceTests
{
    private readonly UserService _service;
    private readonly Mock<IUserRepository> _mockRepo;

    // Constructor that initializes the SUT (UserService) once
    public UserServiceTests()
    {
        // Mock the repository
        _mockRepo = new Mock<IUserRepository>();
        
        // Instantiate the UserService with the mocked repository
        _service = new UserService(_mockRepo.Object);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void GetUser_ShouldReturnCorrectUser()
    {
        // Arrange
        var user = new User { Id = 1, Name = "John Doe" };

        // Set up the mock to return the user when GetUserById is called
        _mockRepo.Setup(repo => repo.GetUserById(1)).Returns(user);

        // Act
        var result = _service.GetUser(1);

        // Assert
        result.Should().BeEquivalentTo(user);  // Verify the result matches the mocked user
    }

    [Fact]
    public void AddUser_ShouldInvokeAddUserMethod()
    {
        // Arrange
        var user = new User { Id = 1, Name = "Jane Doe" };

        // Act
        _service.AddUser(user);

        // Assert: Verify AddUser method was called exactly once
        _mockRepo.Verify(repo => repo.AddUser(It.IsAny<User>()), Times.Once);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void GetAllUsers_ShouldReturnUsers()
    {
        // Arrange
        var users = new List<User>
        {
            new User { Id = 1, Name = "John Doe" },
            new User { Id = 2, Name = "Jane Doe" }
        };

        // Set up the mock to return a list of users when GetAllUsers is called
        _mockRepo.Setup(repo => repo.GetAllUsers()).Returns(users);

        // Act
        var result = _service.GetAllUsers();

        // Assert
        result.Should().BeEquivalentTo(users);
    }
}

```

### Explanation of Moq Usage:

1. **Mocking the Repository**:  
   - We create a mock of `IUserRepository` using `var mockRepo = new Mock<IUserRepository>();`.
   
2. **Setting Up Behavior**:  
   - `mockRepo.Setup(repo => repo.GetUserById(1)).Returns(user);` tells Moq to return a specific `user` when the `GetUserById(1)` method is called.

3. **Injecting the Mock into the Service**:  
   - `var service = new UserService(mockRepo.Object);` injects the mocked repository into the `UserService`.

4. **Verifying Method Calls**:  
   - `mockRepo.Verify(repo => repo.AddUser(It.IsAny<User>()), Times.Once);` ensures that the `AddUser` method was called once during the test.

5. **Assertions**:  
   - We use **FluentAssertions** (`Should().BeEquivalentTo`) to verify that the result returned by the service matches the expected data.

### Key Points in Mocking:

1. **Setup**: Use `.Setup()` to define the behavior of the mock object for specific methods.
   
2. **Verification**: Use `.Verify()` to check if certain methods were called on the mock with the expected parameters.

3. **Return Values**: You can mock return values with `.Returns()`, and even chain multiple return values for sequential calls using `.ReturnsSequence()`. For example, `mockRepo.Setup(repo => repo.GetAllUsers()).Returns(users);` is used to mock the `GetAllUsers` method to return a list of users.

4. **It.IsAny<T>()**: This is used to match any parameter of a given type. For example, `It.IsAny<User>()` will match any `User` object passed to the method.

5. **Mocking Concrete Classes**: Moq can also mock **virtual methods** or **abstract methods** in concrete classes, not just interfaces.

6. **Avoid Mocking Real Objects**: Only mock dependencies that are external to the unit being tested (like repositories, APIs, or services). Don’t mock simple methods or logic that belongs within the SUT.

---

### Conclusion

- **Moq** allows you to easily mock interfaces or virtual methods, making it simpler to isolate the behavior of the SUT in unit tests.
- It’s common to mock database repositories, services, or other dependencies to avoid testing with real external systems like databases.
- Use **Setup**, **Verify**, and **Return Values** to control and assert mock behavior.

### Can You Unit Test Static Methods?

Yes, you **can** unit test static methods, but they come with some challenges. Generally, static methods are harder to test and isolate because they don’t allow for easy mocking or dependency injection. This makes them more tightly coupled to their environment and difficult to replace during tests.

Here’s why unit testing static methods can be challenging and how you might approach testing them.

---

### Challenges with Unit Testing Static Methods

1. **No Dependency Injection**: 
   - Static methods don’t rely on instances of classes, so you can’t inject mock dependencies into them. This makes it hard to isolate the behavior of the static method from other parts of the system.
   
2. **Global State**: 
   - Static methods can modify or rely on global state, which can lead to side effects. If one test changes the global state, it can affect other tests, leading to flaky tests.
   
3. **Difficult to Mock**: 
   - You can’t mock static methods using common mocking frameworks like **Moq**. This means you can't easily replace the static method with a mock that behaves as you want in your tests.

4. **Tight Coupling**: 
   - Static methods often tightly couple your code to specific implementations. This makes it hard to change or extend the behavior without affecting a large part of the application.

---

### How to Unit Test Static Methods

Despite these challenges, there are a few strategies you can use to unit test static methods:

1. **Refactor to Non-Static Methods (Best Practice)**:
   - One of the best approaches is to **refactor** static methods into instance methods that can be mocked or injected with dependencies. This allows for more testable and maintainable code.

2. **Use of Wrapper Classes**:
   - If you cannot refactor the static method, you can wrap the static method inside an instance class that implements an interface. This way, you can mock the wrapper class in your unit tests.
   
3. **Static Method Wrapping with Delegates**:
   - Another approach is to use **delegates** to wrap static methods. This allows you to replace the delegate with a mock or alternate implementation during tests.

4. **Reflection (Limited Usage)**:
   - In some cases, you can use **reflection** to invoke and test static methods. This is more of a workaround and can be error-prone and harder to maintain, so it should be used sparingly.

---

### Example of Refactoring Static Methods for Unit Testing

Let’s start with a simple static method and see how it can be refactored for better testability.

#### Original Static Method

```csharp
public static class MathHelper
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

While this method is simple and easy to test, static methods are harder to mock in a larger, more complex codebase. Let's refactor it for better testability.

#### Refactored to Instance Method

```csharp
public interface IMathHelper
{
    int Add(int a, int b);
}

public class MathHelper : IMathHelper
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### Unit Test for Refactored MathHelper

```csharp
using Moq;
using Xunit;

public class MathHelperTests
{
    private readonly IMathHelper _mathHelper;

    public MathHelperTests()
    {
        // Use dependency injection to mock the MathHelper interface
        var mockMathHelper = new Mock<IMathHelper>();
        mockMathHelper.Setup(m => m.Add(It.IsAny<int>(), It.IsAny<int>())).Returns(5); // Mock behavior
        _mathHelper = mockMathHelper.Object;
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
    {
        var result = _mathHelper.Add(2, 3);
        result.Should().Be(5);
    }
}
```

Now that the static method is refactored into an instance method, you can mock and test it much more easily using Moq and other unit testing techniques.

---

### What If Refactoring Isn't an Option?

If you **cannot** refactor the static method (e.g., it’s part of an external library or you want to avoid making large changes to existing code), here are some alternatives:

#### Wrapping Static Methods in a Non-Static Class

You can create a wrapper class that exposes the static method as an instance method, making it more testable.

```csharp
public class MathHelperWrapper
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return MathHelper.Add(a, b); // Wrap the static method in an instance method
    }
}
```

Now you can mock or test `MathHelperWrapper` instead of directly testing the static `MathHelper`.

---

### Example Using Delegates

Here’s how you might wrap static methods using delegates to make them more testable:

```csharp
public class MathHelperDelegate
{
    private readonly Func<int, int, int> _add;

    public MathHelperDelegate(Func<int, int, int> add)
    {
        _add = add;
    }

    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return _add(a, b);
    }
}
```

In your tests, you can pass a delegate that mimics the static method's behavior:

```csharp
public class MathHelperTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
    {
        var mathHelperDelegate = new MathHelperDelegate((a, b) => a + b);  // Delegate mimicking static method
        var result = mathHelperDelegate.Add(2, 3);
        result.Should().Be(5);
    }
}
```

---

### When Should You Avoid Static Methods?

In general, you should avoid static methods when:

1. **Testability**: The method interacts with global state or is hard to mock.
2. **Flexibility**: You need flexibility to change the behavior of the method.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Static methods tend to tightly couple your code. For example, they might require you to use certain global resources or state, making the code less modular and harder to maintain.

---

### Conclusion

While it is possible to **unit test static methods**, they can introduce **tight coupling**, **global state**, and other issues that make testing harder. Whenever possible, **refactor** static methods into instance methods to make them more flexible and testable. 

If refactoring isn’t feasible, you can still test static methods by using **wrappers**, **delegates**, or **reflection**, but these approaches might lead to more complicated code.

### More Complex Examples of Unit Testing API Controllers with Mocked Dependencies

In real-world scenarios, controllers may have more complex dependencies, such as:

-   Multiple service layers (business logic, data access, etc.)

-   External services or APIs

-   Complex interactions (e.g., pagination, filtering)

-   Error handling (exceptions, validation failures)

Let's walk through a more complex example of unit testing an API controller with **multiple dependencies**, **error handling**, and **complex logic**.

### Scenario: `OrderController` with Multiple Dependencies

Consider an `OrderController` that handles order-related operations, such as creating an order, retrieving orders, and updating order statuses. It depends on:

-   An **`IOrderService`** to handle business logic.

-   A **`IProductService`** to validate products.

-   A **`IPaymentService`** to handle payment processing.

This example will also include **error handling** and **validation**.

### 1\. **Define the Interfaces and Controller**

#### IOrderService

```csharp
public interface IOrderService
{
    Order CreateOrder(OrderRequest orderRequest);
    Order GetOrderById(int orderId);
    void UpdateOrderStatus(int orderId, string status);
}

```

#### IProductService

```csharp
public interface IProductService
{
    bool ValidateProductAvailability(int productId, int quantity);
}

```

#### IPaymentService

```csharp
public interface IPaymentService
{
    bool ProcessPayment(PaymentDetails paymentDetails);
}

```

#### OrderController

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;
    private readonly IProductService _productService;
    private readonly IPaymentService _paymentService;

    public OrderController(IOrderService orderService, IProductService productService, IPaymentService paymentService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
        _productService = productService;
        _paymentService = paymentService;
    }

    [HttpPost("create")]
    public ActionResult<Order> CreateOrder([FromBody] OrderRequest orderRequest)
    {
        if (!_productService.ValidateProductAvailability(orderRequest.ProductId, orderRequest.Quantity))
        {
            return BadRequest("Product not available.");
        }

        var order = _orderService.CreateOrder(orderRequest);

        if (order == null)
        {
            return StatusCode(500, "Order creation failed.");
        }

        var paymentDetails = new PaymentDetails
        {
            Amount = order.TotalAmount,
            OrderId = order.Id
        };

        var paymentSuccess = _paymentService.ProcessPayment(paymentDetails);

        if (!paymentSuccess)
        {
            return StatusCode(500, "Payment failed.");
        }

        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetOrderById), new { id = order.Id }, order);
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public ActionResult<Order> GetOrderById(int id)
    {
        var order = _orderService.GetOrderById(id);
        if (order == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Ok(order);
    }

    [HttpPut("update-status/{id}")]
    public ActionResult UpdateOrderStatus(int id, [FromBody] string status)
    {
        try
        {
            _orderService.UpdateOrderStatus(id, status);
            return NoContent();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return StatusCode(500, ex.Message);
        }
    }
}

```

### Explanation of `OrderController`:

-   **CreateOrder**:

    -   Checks product availability using `IProductService`.

    -   Creates the order with `IOrderService`.

    -   Processes payment using `IPaymentService`.

    -   Returns appropriate status codes and messages based on the outcomes.

-   **GetOrderById**:

    -   Fetches an order by ID using `IOrderService`.

    -   Returns `404 Not Found` if the order does not exist.

-   **UpdateOrderStatus**:

    -   Updates the order status using `IOrderService`.

    -   Handles exceptions and returns an appropriate `500 Internal Server Error`.

* * * * *

### 2\. **Unit Test for `OrderController` with Mocked Dependencies**

Now we will unit test the `OrderController`, mocking all dependencies (`IOrderService`, `IProductService`, and `IPaymentService`). We'll handle multiple test scenarios such as:

-   Valid order creation.

-   Invalid product availability.

-   Payment failure.

-   Order retrieval.

#### Setting Up the Test Project

Make sure you have the following NuGet packages:

```
dotnet add package Moq
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package FluentAssertions
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing

```

#### Unit Test for `OrderController`

Unit testing **asynchronous methods** in ASP.NET Core controllers is similar to testing synchronous methods, but with a few additional considerations, such as handling `Task`-based methods, using `async`/`await`, and ensuring that the results are verified correctly.

Let’s break down the process of **unit testing asynchronous methods** in controllers, focusing on scenarios like mocking asynchronous service methods, verifying results, and handling timeouts or delays.

### Steps for Unit Testing Async Methods

1. **Ensure Proper Async Usage**: 
   - Ensure your controller action methods are **asynchronous** (using `async`/`await`) and return a `Task` (e.g., `Task<ActionResult>`, `Task<IActionResult>`).
   
2. **Mock Async Service Methods**: 
   - If the controller depends on services that return `Task` or `Task<T>`, you'll need to mock the service methods as asynchronous methods using `Moq`.
   
3. **Write Unit Tests for Async Methods**:
   - Unit test the controller by calling async methods and awaiting their results to ensure the controller behaves correctly.

---

### Example: Unit Testing Async Controller Methods

Let’s walk through an example where we have an **`OrderController`** with **async** methods that interact with an asynchronous service layer.

### 1. **Define the Async Controller and Dependencies**

#### IOrderService

```csharp
public interface IOrderService
{
    Task<Order> GetOrderByIdAsync(int orderId);
    Task<Order> CreateOrderAsync(OrderRequest orderRequest);
    Task UpdateOrderStatusAsync(int orderId, string status);
}
```

#### OrderController (with Async Methods)

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;

    public OrderController(IOrderService orderService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<Order>> GetOrderByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        var order = await _orderService.GetOrderByIdAsync(id);
        if (order == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return Ok(order);
    }

    [HttpPost("create")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<Order>> CreateOrderAsync([FromBody] OrderRequest orderRequest)
    {
        var order = await _orderService.CreateOrderAsync(orderRequest);

        if (order == null)
        {
            return StatusCode(500, "Order creation failed.");
        }

        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetOrderByIdAsync), new { id = order.Id }, order);
    }

    [HttpPut("update-status/{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult> UpdateOrderStatusAsync(int id, [FromBody] string status)
    {
        try
        {
            await _orderService.UpdateOrderStatusAsync(id, status);
            return NoContent();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return StatusCode(500, ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

In this controller:
- **`GetOrderByIdAsync`**: Fetches an order by ID.
- **`CreateOrderAsync`**: Creates a new order.
- **`UpdateOrderStatusAsync`**: Updates the status of an order.

The controller methods are asynchronous (`async`/`await`), and the dependencies return `Task<T>`.

### 2. **Unit Test Async Controller Methods**

Now, let’s write unit tests for these async methods. We’ll use **Moq** to mock the asynchronous service methods and **FluentAssertions** for assertions.

#### Setting Up the Test Project

Make sure you have the following NuGet packages:
```bash
dotnet add package Moq
dotnet add package xunit
dotnet add package FluentAssertions
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing
```

#### Unit Test for `OrderController`

```csharp
using Moq;
using FluentAssertions;
using Xunit;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class OrderControllerTests
{
    private readonly Mock<IOrderService> _mockOrderService;
    private readonly OrderController _controller;

    public OrderControllerTests()
    {
        // Arrange: Initialize the mock service and the controller
        _mockOrderService = new Mock<IOrderService>();
        _controller = new OrderController(_mockOrderService.Object);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task GetOrderByIdAsync_ReturnsOk_WhenOrderExists()
    {
        // Arrange: Mock the service method to return a sample order
        var mockOrder = new Order { Id = 1, TotalAmount = 100 };
        _mockOrderService.Setup(service => service.GetOrderByIdAsync(1)).ReturnsAsync(mockOrder);

        // Act: Call GetOrderByIdAsync
        var result = await _controller.GetOrderByIdAsync(1);

        // Assert: Verify that OkObjectResult is returned
        var okResult = result as OkObjectResult;
        okResult.Should().NotBeNull();
        okResult.StatusCode.Should().Be(200);
        okResult.Value.Should().BeEquivalentTo(mockOrder);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task GetOrderByIdAsync_ReturnsNotFound_WhenOrderDoesNotExist()
    {
        // Arrange: Mock the service method to return null
        _mockOrderService.Setup(service => service.GetOrderByIdAsync(1)).ReturnsAsync((Order)null);

        // Act: Call GetOrderByIdAsync
        var result = await _controller.GetOrderByIdAsync(1);

        // Assert: Verify that NotFoundResult is returned
        result.Should().BeOfType<NotFoundResult>();
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task CreateOrderAsync_ReturnsCreated_WhenOrderIsSuccessfullyCreated()
    {
        // Arrange: Mock the service method to return a new order
        var newOrder = new Order { Id = 1, TotalAmount = 100 };
        var orderRequest = new OrderRequest { ProductId = 1, Quantity = 2 };
        _mockOrderService.Setup(service => service.CreateOrderAsync(orderRequest)).ReturnsAsync(newOrder);

        // Act: Call CreateOrderAsync
        var result = await _controller.CreateOrderAsync(orderRequest);

        // Assert: Verify that CreatedAtActionResult is returned
        var createdResult = result as CreatedAtActionResult;
        createdResult.Should().NotBeNull();
        createdResult.StatusCode.Should().Be(201);
        createdResult.RouteValues["id"].Should().Be(newOrder.Id);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task CreateOrderAsync_ReturnsInternalServerError_WhenOrderCreationFails()
    {
        // Arrange: Mock the service method to return null
        var orderRequest = new OrderRequest { ProductId = 1, Quantity = 2 };
        _mockOrderService.Setup(service => service.CreateOrderAsync(orderRequest)).ReturnsAsync((Order)null);

        // Act: Call CreateOrderAsync
        var result = await _controller.CreateOrderAsync(orderRequest);

        // Assert: Verify that StatusCode 500 is returned
        var objectResult = result as ObjectResult;
        objectResult.Should().NotBeNull();
        objectResult.StatusCode.Should().Be(500);
        objectResult.Value.Should().Be("Order creation failed.");
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task UpdateOrderStatusAsync_ReturnsInternalServerError_WhenExceptionOccurs()
    {
        // Arrange: Mock the service method to throw an exception
        _mockOrderService.Setup(service => service.UpdateOrderStatusAsync(It.IsAny<int>(), It.IsAny<string>()))
            .ThrowsAsync(new Exception("Database error"));

        // Act: Call UpdateOrderStatusAsync
        var result = await _controller.UpdateOrderStatusAsync(1, "Shipped");

        // Assert: Verify that StatusCode 500 is returned
        var objectResult = result as ObjectResult;
        objectResult.Should().NotBeNull();
        objectResult.StatusCode.Should().Be(500);
        objectResult.Value.Should().Be("Database error");
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Mocking Async Methods**: 
   - We mock the async methods in the service using `ReturnsAsync()`. This allows the mocked service to return a `Task<T>` asynchronously, simulating real service behavior.
   
   Example:  
   ```csharp
   _mockOrderService.Setup(service => service.GetOrderByIdAsync(1)).ReturnsAsync(mockOrder);
   ```

2. **Awaiting Results**:
   - For async methods, we **`await`** the result of controller actions to ensure the asynchronous execution is handled correctly in the test.
   
3. **Verifying the Correct Result**:
   - We verify that the controller’s result is an `OkObjectResult`, `NotFoundResult`, `CreatedAtActionResult`, or `ObjectResult` based on the expected status codes.
   
4. **Exception Handling**:
   - The `UpdateOrderStatusAsync` test simulates an exception in the service layer, and we ensure the controller returns a `500 Internal Server Error` when an exception occurs.

5. **FluentAssertions**:
   - We use **FluentAssertions** to assert the expected results, making the assertions more readable and expressive (e.g., `.Should().Be(200)`).

---

### Conclusion

Unit testing **asynchronous** methods in API controllers involves:
- Mocking async service methods using `Moq`'s `ReturnsAsync()` to simulate asynchronous behavior.
- Using `await` to handle asynchronous execution in your tests.
- Asserting the correct behavior based on expected outcomes (status codes, return values).

By following these principles, you can ensure your async controller methods are correctly tested, handling both success and failure scenarios effectively.



### Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Its Best Practices

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual code is implemented. The main goal of TDD is to write only the code necessary to pass the tests, which results in cleaner, more maintainable, and well-tested code.

### TDD Cycle: **Red-Green-Refactor**

The TDD cycle consists of three main steps:

1. **Red**: Write a test for a new functionality. The test will fail because the functionality doesn’t exist yet.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass. The focus is on making the test pass, not writing the perfect solution.
3. **Refactor**: Once the test passes, clean up the code. This step focuses on improving the code structure, reducing duplication, and enhancing readability while keeping the tests passing.

### Key Principles of TDD:

1. **Write Tests First**: The core of TDD is that tests are written before the actual code. This helps ensure that the code meets the requirements and encourages developers to think about the functionality before writing the implementation.
   
2. **Small Steps**: Break down the functionality into small steps. This makes it easier to write tests and ensures the tests cover small, manageable units of functionality.

3. **Refactor Safely**: With a comprehensive suite of tests, refactoring becomes safer because you can verify that the code still works after any changes.

4. **Frequent Testing**: As you write each small piece of functionality, you write tests to validate that piece. This leads to frequent test execution and ensures that each piece of functionality is well-covered.

5. **Test for Behavior, Not Implementation**: Write tests based on expected behavior rather than implementation details. This makes tests more flexible and robust.

### Example of TDD Process

Let’s walk through a simple example of TDD in a real-world scenario: a **`Calculator`** class that performs basic arithmetic operations.

#### Step 1: **Red** (Write a failing test)

Before implementing the `Add` method in the `Calculator` class, we write a test for it:

```csharp
public class CalculatorTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Add_ShouldReturnCorrectSum()
    {
        // Arrange
        var calculator = new Calculator();

        // Act
        var result = calculator.Add(2, 3);

        // Assert
        result.Should().Be(5);
    }
}
```

At this point, the test fails because the `Calculator` class and the `Add` method do not exist yet.

#### Step 2: **Green** (Write minimal code to pass the test)

Now, we implement the `Add` method to make the test pass:

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }
}
```

After implementing this minimal code, the test should now pass successfully.

#### Step 3: **Refactor** (Improve the code)

Now that the test passes, you can look for any improvements or refactor opportunities. For this simple example, there might not be much to refactor. But in more complex scenarios, this could involve cleaning up duplicate code, improving naming conventions, or making the code more efficient.

---

### Best Practices for TDD

1. **Start with Simple Tests**: Begin by writing simple, focused tests for individual pieces of functionality. Don’t try to write large, complex tests upfront.

2. **Test Small Units of Work**: Write tests for small pieces of functionality, like methods or functions. This makes it easier to isolate bugs and focus on one thing at a time.

3. **Write Tests for Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on testing the expected behavior of the code, not its internal implementation. This makes tests more robust to changes in implementation.

4. **Refactor After Every Green**: Always clean up and refactor your code after your tests pass. This ensures your code stays clean and maintainable.

5. **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Don’t write code for edge cases or try to solve every potential problem upfront. Write just enough code to pass the test, and then refactor as necessary.

6. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should be independent of others. This ensures that if one test fails, it doesn’t affect the others.

7. **Run Tests Frequently**: Run your tests frequently as you write code. This helps catch errors early and gives you quick feedback on your progress.

8. **Write Meaningful Tests**: Make sure your tests are clear and meaningful. They should describe the behavior of the system and should be easy to understand. Use descriptive names for your test methods.

9. **Use Mocks and Stubs**: When testing, it’s often useful to mock dependencies (e.g., databases, external services) to isolate the component you're testing. This helps ensure that the test is focused on the behavior of the component, not its dependencies.

10. **Test Boundary Conditions and Edge Cases**: While it’s tempting to focus on "happy path" tests, it’s important to also test edge cases, boundary conditions, and error handling to ensure robustness.

11. **Fail Fast**: When a test fails, fix it immediately. Don’t let a failing test linger in the test suite for too long.

### Example: More Complex TDD Example with Dependencies

Consider a service that calculates discounts based on customer data and product information. This service might have dependencies like `ICustomerService` and `IProductService`.

#### Step 1: **Write the Failing Test**

Let’s start by writing a test for the discount calculation:

```csharp
public class DiscountServiceTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void CalculateDiscount_ShouldApplyCorrectDiscountForCustomer()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockCustomerService = new Mock<ICustomerService>();
        var mockProductService = new Mock<IProductService>();
        var discountService = new DiscountService(mockCustomerService.Object, mockProductService.Object);
        var customer = new Customer { Id = 1, Status = "Gold" };
        var product = new Product { Id = 101, Price = 100 };

        mockCustomerService.Setup(service => service.GetCustomerById(1)).Returns(customer);
        mockProductService.Setup(service => service.GetProductById(101)).Returns(product);

        // Act
        var discount = discountService.CalculateDiscount(1, 101);

        // Assert
        discount.Should().Be(20); // Assuming 20% discount for "Gold" customers
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: **Write the Code to Make the Test Pass**

Now, we implement the `DiscountService` and the required dependencies:

```csharp
public class DiscountService
{
    private readonly ICustomerService _customerService;
    private readonly IProductService _productService;

    public DiscountService(ICustomerService customerService, IProductService productService)
    {
        _customerService = customerService;
        _productService = productService;
    }

    public decimal CalculateDiscount(int customerId, int productId)
    {
        var customer = _customerService.GetCustomerById(customerId);
        var product = _productService.GetProductById(productId);

        if (customer.Status == "Gold")
        {
            return product.Price * 0.20m; // 20% discount for Gold customers
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: **Refactor**

After the test passes, we can refactor the code. For example, we can move the discount logic to a separate method if it becomes more complex, but for now, the logic is simple.

### Benefits of TDD

1. **Improved Code Quality**: By writing tests first, you ensure that your code meets the requirements and is testable from the start. This leads to fewer bugs and better-designed code.
   
2. **Refactor-Friendly**: With a comprehensive suite of tests, you can refactor your code without worrying about breaking existing functionality.

3. **Documentation**: Tests act as live documentation for your code, making it easier for others to understand the expected behavior of your system.

4. **Confidence in Code Changes**: Since you run tests frequently, you can be confident that changes you make to your code won’t break existing functionality.

---

### Conclusion

Test-Driven Development (TDD) helps you write clean, maintainable, and testable code. By following the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle, you ensure that your code meets the requirements while keeping it flexible for future changes. TDD encourages you to focus on behavior and make small, incremental improvements, leading to higher code quality and fewer defects.
